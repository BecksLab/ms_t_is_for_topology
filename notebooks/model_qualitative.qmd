Basically the important thing here is that we want to take what is currently table 1 in the manuscript and turn that into a more elaborate 'traits table'.

```{r}
#| include: false
#| warning: false
library(tidyverse)
library(gt)

trait_tbl <-
  read.csv("data/traits_table.csv")  %>% 
  tibble()
```

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| echo: false
#| label: tbl-traits
#| tbl-cap: "Traits table for the different model families"

trait_tbl  %>% 
  group_by(trait_grp)  %>% 
  gt()  %>% 
  sub_missing(
    missing_text = ""
  )

```
