<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Autecology and the Filling of Ecospace: Key Metazoan Radiations;,citation_abstract=Abstract: All possible combinations of six tiering positions in relation to the substratum/water interface, six motility levels and six feeding strategies define a complete theoretical ecospace of 216 potential modes of life for marine animals. The number of modes of life actually utilized specifies realized ecospace. Owing to constraints of effectiveness and efficiency the modern marine fauna utilizes only about half the potential number of modes of life, two-thirds of which (62 of 92) are utilized by animals with readily preserved, mineralized hard parts. Realized ecospace has increased markedly since the early evolution of animal ecosystems. The Ediacaran fauna utilized at most 12 modes of life, with just two practised by skeletal organisms. A total of 30 modes of life are recorded in the Early and Middle Cambrian, 19 of which were utilized by skeletal organisms. The other 11 are documented from soft-bodied animals preserved in the Chengjiang and Burgess Shale Konservat-Lagerstätten. The number of modes of life utilized by skeletal organisms increased by more than 50 per cent during the Ordovician radiation to a Late Ordovician total of 30. Between the Late Ordovician and the Recent the number of utilized modes of life has doubled again. The autecological and taxonomic diversity histories of the marine metazoa appear to be broadly parallel, and future studies of theoretical ecospace utilization should provide more detailed tests of pattern and process in the ecological history of the metazoa.;,citation_author=Richard K.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Mangal.jl and EcologicalNetworks.jl: Two complementary packages for analyzing ecological networks in Julia;,citation_abstract=Network ecology is an emerging field of study describing species interactions (e.g. predation, pollination) in a biological community. Ecological networks, in which two species are connected if they can interact, are a mathematical representation of all interactions encountered in a given ecosystem. Anchored in graph theory, the methods developed in network ecology are remarkably rigorous and biologically insightful. Indeed, many ecological and evolutionary processes are driven by species interactions and network structure (i.e. the arrangement of links in ecological networks). The study of ecological networks, from data importation and simulation to data analysis and visualization, requires a coherent and efficient set of numerical tools. With its powerful and dynamic type system, the Julia programming language provides a very good and fast computing environment suitable for ecological research. Julia’s typing system notably ensures that appropriate methods are used when a function is applied to different types of ecological data, which therefore minimizes the risk of committing errors of analysis and interpretation in network ecology. Mangal.jl and EcologicalNetworks.jl are two novel and complementary Julia packages designed to conduct research in network ecology efficiently. Researchers studying a broad range of ecological networks can read the data and metadata of numerous well-documented networks using Mangal.jl, and analyze their properties using EcologicalNetworks.jl.;,citation_author=Francis Banville;,citation_author=Steve Vissault;,citation_author=Timothée Poisot;,citation_publication_date=2021-05;,citation_cover_date=2021-05;,citation_year=2021;,citation_issue=61;,citation_doi=10.21105/joss.02721;,citation_issn=2475-9066;,citation_volume=6;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Open Source Software;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Addressing the Eltonian shortfall with trait-based interaction models;,citation_abstract=We have very limited knowledge of how species interact in most communities and ecosystems despite trophic relationships being fundamental for linking biodiversity to ecosystem functioning. A promising approach to fill this gap is to predict interactions based on functional traits, but many questions remain about how well we can predict interactions for different taxa, ecosystems and amounts of input data. Here, we built a new traits-based model of trophic interactions for European vertebrates and found that even models calibrated with 0.1% of the interactions (100 out of 71 k) estimated the full European vertebrate food web reasonably well. However, predators were easier to predict than prey, especially for some clades (e.g. fowl and storks) and local food web connectance was consistently overestimated. Our results demonstrate the ability to rapidly generate food webs when empirical data are lackingan important step towards a more complete and spatially explicit description of food webs.;,citation_author=Dominique Caron;,citation_author=Luigi Maiorano;,citation_author=Wilfried Thuiller;,citation_author=Laura J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Trophic interaction models predict interactions across space, not food webs;,citation_abstract=Aim: Trophic interactions are central to our understanding of essential ecosystem functions as well as their stability. Predicting these interactions has become increasingly common due to the lack of empirical data on trophic interactions for most taxa in most ecosystems. We aim to determine whether and how accurately we can extrapolate to new communities both in terms of pairwise predator-prey interactions and higher level food web attributes (i.e., species position, food web-level properties). Location: Canada, Europe, Tanzania. Time period: Current. Major taxa studied: Terrestrial vertebrates Methods: We use a trait-based model of pairwise trophic interactions, calibrated independently on four different terrestrial vertebrate food webs (Canadian tundra, Serengeti, alpine south-eastern Pyrenees, and entire Europe) and assess the ability of each calibrated instance of the model to predict alternative food webs. We test how well predictions recover individual predator-prey interactions as well as higher level food web properties across geographical locations. Results: We find that, given enough phylogenetic and environmental similarities between food webs, trait-based models predict most interactions and their absence correctly (AUC &amp;amp;amp;gt; 0.82), even across highly contrasting environments. However, network metrics were less well-predicted than single interactions by our models. Predicted food webs were more connected, less modular, and had higher mean trophic levels than observed. Main conclusions: Theory predicts that the variability observed in food webs can be explained by differences in trait distributions and trait-matching relationships. Trait-based models can predict potential interactions amongst species in an ecosystem when calibrated using food web data from reasonably similar ecosystems. This suggests that food webs vary spatially primarily through changes in trait distributions. These models, however, are less good at predicting system level food web properties. We thus highlight the need for methodological advances to simultaneously address trophic interactions and the structure of food webs across time and space.;,citation_author=Dominique Caron;,citation_author=Ulrich Brose;,citation_author=Miguel Lurgi;,citation_author=Guillaume Blanchet;,citation_author=Dominique Gravel;,citation_author=Laura J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Phylogenetic constraints and adaptation explain food-web structure;,citation_abstract=Food webs are descriptions of who eats whom in an ecosystem. Although extremely complex and variable, their structure possesses basic regularities1,2,3,4,5,6. A fascinating question is to find a simple model capturing the underlying processes behind these repeatable patterns. Until now, two models have been devised for the description of trophic interactions within a natural community7,8. Both are essentially based on the concept of ecological niche, with the consumers organized along a single niche dimension; for example, prey size8,9. Unfortunately, they fail to describe adequately recent and high-quality data. Here, we propose a new model built on the hypothesis that any species’ diet is the consequence of phylogenetic constraints and adaptation. Simple rules incorporating both concepts yield food webs whose structure is very close to real data. Consumers are organized in groups forming a nested hierarchy, which better reflects the complexity and multidimensionality of most natural systems.;,citation_author=Marie-France Cattin;,citation_author=Louis-Félix Bersier;,citation_author=Carolin Banašek-Richter;,citation_author=Richard Baltensperger;,citation_author=Jean-Pierre Gabriel;,citation_publication_date=2004-02;,citation_cover_date=2004-02;,citation_year=2004;,citation_issue=6977;,citation_doi=10.1038/nature02327;,citation_issn=1476-4687;,citation_volume=427;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Nature;,citation_publisher=Nature Publishing Group;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Transient dynamics and foodweb complexity in the LotkaVolterra cascade model;,citation_abstract=How does the longterm behaviour near equilibrium of model food webs correlate with their shortterm transient dynamics? Here, simulations of the LotkaVolterra cascade model of food webs provide the first evidence to answer this question. Transient behaviour is measured by resilience, reactivity, the maximum amplification of a perturbation and the time at which the maximum amplification occurs. Model food webs with a higher probability of local asymptotic stability may be less resilient and may have a larger transient growth of perturbations. Given a fixed connectance, the sizes and durations of transient responses to perturbations increase with the number of species. Given a fixed number of species, as connectance increases, the sizes and durations of transient responses to perturbations may increase or decrease depending on the type of link that is varied. Reactivity is more sensitive to changes in the number of donorcontrolled links than to changes in the number of recipientcontrolled links, while resilience is more sensitive to changes in the number of recipientcontrolled links than to changes in the number of donorcontrolled links. Transient behaviour is likely to be one of the important factors affecting the persistence of ecological communities.;,citation_author=X. Chen;,citation_author=J. E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Community Food Webs: Data and Theory;,citation_abstract=Food webs hold a central place in ecology. They describe which organisms feed on which others in natural habitats. This book describes recently discovered empirical regularities in real food webs: it proposes a novel theory unifying many of these regularities, as well as extensive empirical data. After a general introduction, reviewing the empirical and theoretical discoveries about food webs, the second portion of the book shows that community food webs obey several striking phenomenological regularities. Some of these unify, regardless of habitat. Others differentiate, showing that habitat significantly influences structure. The third portion of the book presents a theoretical analysis of some of the unifying empirical regularities. The fourth portion of the book presents 13 community food webs. Collected from scattered sources and carefully edited, they are the empirical basis for the results in the volume. The largest available set of data on community food webs provides a valuable foundation for future studies of community food webs. The book is intended for graduate students, teachers and researchers primarily in ecology. The theoretical portions of the book provide materials useful to teachers of applied combinatorics, in particular, random graphs.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Food webs and the dimensionality of trophic niche space;,citation_abstract=If the trophic niche of a kind of organism is a connected region in niche space, then it is possible for trophic niche overlaps to be described in a one-dimensional niche space if and only if the trophic niche overlap graph is an interval graph. An analysis of 30 food webs, using the combinatorial theory of interval graphs, suggests that a niche space of dimension 1 suffices, with unexpectedly high frequency and perhaps always, to describe the trophic niche overlaps implied by real food webs in single habitats. Consequently, real food webs fall in a small subset of the set of mathematically possible food webs. That real food webs are compatible with one-dimensional trophic niche spaces, more often than can be explained by chance alone, has not been noticed previously.;,citation_author=Joel E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A stochastic theory of community food webs I. Models and aggregated data;,citation_abstract=Three recently discovered quantitative empirical generalizations describe major features of the structure of community food webs. These generalizations are: (i) a species scaling law: the mean proportions of basal, intermediate and top species remain invariant at approximately 0.19, 0.53, and 0.29, respectively, over the range of variation in the number of species in a web; (ii) a link scaling law : the mean proportions of trophic links in the categories basal-intermediate, basal-top, intermediateintermediate, and intermediatetop remain invariant at approximately 0.27, 0.08, 0.30 and 0.35, respectively, over the range of variation in the number of species in a web; and (iii) a link-species scaling law: the ratio of mean trophic links to species remains invariant at approximately 1.86, over the range of variation in the number of species in a web. This paper presents a model, the only successful one among several attempts, in which the first two of these empirical generalizations can be derived as a consequence of the third. The model assumes that species are ordered in a cascade or hierarchy such that a given species can prey on only those species below it and can be preyed on by only those species above it in the hierarchy.;,citation_author=Joel E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Analysing ecological networks of species interactions;,citation_abstract=Network approaches to ecological questions have been increasingly used, particularly in recent decades. The abstraction of ecological systems  such as communities  through networks of interactions between their components indeed provides a way to summarize this information with single objects. The methodological framework derived from graph theory also provides numerous approaches and measures to analyze these objects and can offer new perspectives on established ecological theories as well as tools to address new challenges. However, prior to using these methods to test ecological hypotheses, it is necessary that we understand, adapt, and use them in ways that both allow us to deliver their full potential and account for their limitations. Here, we attempt to increase the accessibility of network approaches by providing a review of the tools that have been developed so far, with  what we believe to be  their appropriate uses and potential limitations. This is not an exhaustive review of all methods and metrics, but rather, an overview of tools that are robust, informative, and ecologically sound. After providing a brief presentation of species interaction networks and how to build them in order to summarize ecological information of different types, we then classify methods and metrics by the types of ecological questions that they can be used to answer from global to local scales, including methods for hypothesis testing and future perspectives. Specifically, we show how the organization of species interactions in a community yields different network structures (e.g., more or less dense, modular or nested), how different measures can be used to describe and quantify these emerging structures, and how to compare communities based on these differences in structures. Within networks, we illustrate metrics that can be used to describe and compare the functional and dynamic roles of species based on their position in the network and the organization of their interactions as well as associated new methods to test the significance of these results. Lastly, we describe potential fruitful avenues for new methodological developments to address novel ecological questions.;,citation_author=Eva Delmas;,citation_author=Mathilde Besson;,citation_author=Marie-Hélène Brice;,citation_author=Laura A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Compilation and Network Analyses of Cambrian Food Webs;,citation_abstract=A rich body of empirically grounded theory has developed about food websthe networks of feeding relationships among species within habitats. However, detailed food-web data and analyses are lacking for ancient ecosystems, largely because of the low resolution of taxa coupled with uncertain and incomplete information about feeding interactions. These impediments appear insurmountable for most fossil assemblages; however, a few assemblages with excellent soft-body preservation across trophic levels are candidates for food-web data compilation and topological analysis. Here we present plausible, detailed food webs for the Chengjiang and Burgess Shale assemblages from the Cambrian Period. Analyses of degree distributions and other structural network properties, including sensitivity analyses of the effects of uncertainty associated with Cambrian diet designations, suggest that these early Paleozoic communities share remarkably similar topology with modern food webs. Observed regularities reflect a systematic dependence of structure on the numbers of taxa and links in a web. Most aspects of Cambrian food-web structure are well-characterized by a simple “niche model,” which was developed for modern food webs and takes into account this scale dependence. However, a few aspects of topology differ between the ancient and recent webs: longer path lengths between species and more species in feeding loops in the earlier Chengjiang web, and higher variability in the number of links per species for both Cambrian webs. Our results are relatively insensitive to the exclusion of low-certainty or random links. The many similarities between Cambrian and recent food webs point toward surprisingly strong and enduring constraints on the organization of complex feeding interactions among metazoan species. The few differences could reflect a transition to more strongly integrated and constrained trophic organization within ecosystems following the rapid diversification of species, body plans, and trophic roles during the Cambrian radiation. More research is needed to explore the generality of food-web structure through deep time and across habitats, especially to investigate potential mechanisms that could give rise to similar structure, as well as any differences.;,citation_author=Jennifer A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Network structure and robustness of marine food webs;,citation_abstract=Previous studies suggest that food-web theory has yet to account for major differences in food-web properties of marine versus other types of ecosystems. We examined this issue by analyzing the network structure of food webs for the Northeast US Shelf, a Caribbean reef, and Benguela, off South Africa. The values of connectance (links per species2), link density (links per species), mean chain length, and fractions of intermediate, omnivorous, and cannibalistic taxa of these marine webs are somewhat high but still within the ranges observed in other webs. We further compared the marine webs by using the empirically corroborated “niche model” that accounts for observed variation in diversity (taxon number) and complexity (connectance). Our results substantiate previously reported results for estuarine, fresh-water, and terrestrial datasets, which suggests that food webs from different types of ecosystems with variable diversity and complexity share fundamental structural and ordering characteristics. Analyses of potential secondary extinctions resulting from species loss show that the structural robustness of marine food webs is also consistent with trends from other food webs. As expected, given their relatively high connectance, marine food webs appear fairly robust to loss of most-connected taxa as well as random taxa. Still, the short average path length between marine taxa (1.6 links) suggests that effects from perturbations, such as overfishing, can be transmitted more widely throughout marine ecosystems than previously appreciated.;,citation_author=Ja Dunne;,citation_author=Rj Williams;,citation_author=Nd Martinez;,citation_publication_date=2004;,citation_cover_date=2004;,citation_year=2004;,citation_doi=10.3354/meps273291;,citation_issn=0171-8630, 1616-1599;,citation_volume=273;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Marine Ecology Progress Series;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Inferring food web structure from predatorprey body size relationships;,citation_abstract=Current global changes make it important to be able to predict which interactions will occur in the emerging ecosystems. Most of the current methods to infer the existence of interactions between two species require a good knowledge of their behaviour or a direct observation of interactions. In this paper, we overcome these limitations by developing a method, inspired from the niche model of food web structure, using the statistical relationship between predator and prey body size to infer the matrix of potential interactions among a pool of species. The novelty of our approach is to infer, for any species of a given species pool, the three species-specific parameters of the niche model. The method applies to both local and metaweb scales. It allows one to evaluate the feeding interactions of a new species entering the community. We find that this method gives robust predictions of the structure of food webs and that its efficiency is increased when the strength of the bodysize relationship between predators and preys increases. We finally illustrate the potential of the method to infer the metaweb structure of pelagic fishes of the Mediterranean sea under different global change scenarios.;,citation_author=Dominique Gravel;,citation_author=Timothée Poisot;,citation_author=Camille Albouy;,citation_author=Laure Velez;,citation_author=David Mouillot;,citation_publication_date=2013;,citation_cover_date=2013;,citation_year=2013;,citation_issue=11;,citation_doi=10.1111/2041-210X.12103;,citation_issn=2041-210X;,citation_volume=4;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Methods in Ecology and Evolution;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=PanTHERIA: A species-level database of life history, ecology, and geography of extant and recently extinct mammals;,citation_abstract=Analyses of life-history, ecological, and geographic trait differences among species, their causes, correlates, and likely consequences are increasingly important for understanding and conserving biodiversity in the face of rapid global change. Assembling multispecies trait data from diverse literature sources into a single comprehensive data set requires detailed consideration of methods to reliably compile data for particular species, and to derive single estimates from multiple sources based on different techniques and definitions. Here we describe PanTHERIA, a species-level data set compiled for analysis of life history, ecology, and geography of all known extant and recently extinct mammals. PanTHERIA is derived from a database capable of holding multiple geo-referenced values for variables within a species containing 100 740 lines of biological data for extant and recently extinct mammalian species, collected over a period of three years by 20 individuals. PanTHERIA also includes spatial databases of mammalian geographic ranges and global climatic and anthropogenic variables. Here we detail how the data fields are extracted and defined for PanTHERIA using a customized data input format (MammalForm); how data were collected from the literature, species names and sources tracked, error-checking and validation procedures applied, and how data were consolidated into species-level values for each variable. Tables of the consolidated species-level values are made available for each of two recent species-level taxonomic classifications of mammals, as well as associated taxonomic synonymy conversion and data-input files. This study provides a useful guide to prospective researchers on how to structure and codify life-history, ecological, geographic, and taxonomic data and methods to extract meaningful species-level traits. It also provides comprehensive information on traits like size, diet, environmental conditions, and ecology to permit macroecological and macroevolutionary analyses of this important clade.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Chasing Ecological Interactions;,citation_abstract=Basic research on biodiversity has concentrated on individual speciesnaming new species, studying distribution patterns, and analyzing their evolutionary relationships. Yet biodiversity is more than a collection of individual species; it is the combination of biological entities and processes that support life on Earth. To understand biodiversity we must catalog it, but we must also assess the ways species interact with other species to provide functional support for the Tree of Life. Ecological interactions may be lost well before the species involved in those interactions go extinct; their ecological functions disappear even though they remain.

Recent advances include development of new methods for measuring fit of models to observed food web data, and thereby testing which are the “best” food web models. The best model could be considered the most efficient with relatively few parameters and high explanatory power. Another recent advance involves adding some additional biology to food web models in the form of foraging theory based on maximisation of energy intake as the predictor of species’ diets in food webs. While it is interesting to compare efficiency among food web models, we believe that such comparisons at least should be interpreted with caution, since they do not account for any differences in motivation, formulation, and potential that might also exist among models.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Size, foraging, and food web structure;,citation_abstract=Understanding what structures ecological communities is vital to answering questions about extinctions, environmental change, trophic cascades, and ecosystem functioning. Optimal foraging theory was conceived to increase such understanding by providing a framework with which to predict species interactions and resulting community structure. Here, we use an optimal foraging model and allometries of foraging variables to predict the structure of real food webs. The qualitative structure of the resulting model provides a more mechanistic basis for the phenomenological rules of previous models. Quantitative analyses show that the model predicts up to 65% of the links in real food webs. The deterministic nature of the model allows analysis of the model’s successes and failures in predicting particular interactions. Predacious and herbivorous feeding interactions are better predicted than pathogenic, parasitoid, and parasitic interactions. Results also indicate that accurate prediction and modeling of some food webs will require incorporating traits other than body size and diet choice models specific to different types of feeding interaction.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Before, during and after megafaunal extinctions: Human impact on Pleistocene-Holocene trophic networks in South Patagonia;,citation_abstract=Worldwide extinctions of large terrestrial vertebrates in the late Pleistocene provide insight on how humans reshape ecological communities. Understanding the ecological causes and consequences of megafaunal extinctions requires integrating approaches to reconstruct the ecological communities from the past. Here, we combined archeological and paleontological evidence with network analyses to understand the changes in ecological communities from late Pleistocene to the Holocene in South Patagonia, the last continental region where the encounter between humans and extinct megafauna occurred. The zooarcheological record suggests humans would have interacted mainly with large-bodied species, which comprise a small subset of the available prey. Accordingly, using network reconstructions and structural analyses, we found that human arrival would have produced minor changes in the overall structure of trophic networks. However, those few novel interactions established by humans would have created multiple indirect paths among megafaunal species. Indirect paths are the route for indirect effects such as competition and increase the vulnerability of interaction networks to perturbations. After the extinctions of most of the megafauna, the impoverished network became structurally simpler and densely connected. Our reconstructions of past trophic networks show that multiple indirect effects, potentially contributing to extinctions, can emerge even from a limited number of novel interactions and illustrate how network organization can affect and be affected by extinctions events.;,citation_author=Mathias M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Global knowledge gaps in species interaction networks data;,citation_abstract=Ecological networks are increasingly studied at large spatial scales, expanding their focus from a conceptual tool for community ecology into one that also addresses questions in biogeography and macroecology. This effort is supported by increased access to standardized information on ecological networks, in the form of openly accessible databases. Yet, there has been no systematic evaluation of the fitness for purpose of these data to explore synthesis questions at very large spatial scales. In particular, because the sampling of ecological networks is a difficult task, they are likely to not have a good representation of the diversity of Earth’s bioclimatic conditions, likely to be spatially aggregated, and therefore unlikely to achieve broad representativeness. In this paper, we analyse over 1300 ecological networks in the mangal.io database, and discuss their coverage of climates, and the geographic areas in which there is a deficit of data on ecological networks. Taken together, our results suggest that while some information about the global structure of ecological networks is available, it remains fragmented over space, with further differences by types of ecological interactions.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Beyond species: Why ecological interaction networks vary through space and time;,citation_abstract=Community ecology is tasked with the considerable challenge of predicting the structure, and properties, of emerging ecosystems. It requires the ability to understand how and why species interact, as this will allow the development of mechanism-based predictive models, and as such to better characterize how ecological mechanisms act locally on the existence of inter-specific interactions. Here we argue that the current conceptualization of species interaction networks is ill-suited for this task. Instead, we propose that future research must start to account for the intrinsic variability of species interactions, then scale up from here onto complex networks. This can be accomplished simply by recognizing that there exists intra-specific variability, in traits or properties related to the establishment of species interactions. By shifting the scale towards population-based processes, we show that this new approach will improve our predictive ability and mechanistic understanding of how species interact over large spatial or temporal scales. Synthesis Although species interactions are the backbone of ecological communities, we have little insights on how (and why) they vary through space and time. In this article, we build on existing empirical literature to show that the same species may happen to interact in different ways when their local abundances vary, their trait distribution changes, or when the environment affects either of these factors.

This approach is interesting, but it is limited by the fact that different assumptions can yield similar results. To overcome this limitation, we develop a purely statistical approach. Body size in terms of an optimal ratio between prey and predator is used as explanatory variable. In 12 observed food webs, this model predicts, on average, 20% of interactions. To analyze the unexplained part, we introduce a latent term: each species is described by two latent traits, foraging and vulnerability, that represent nonmeasured characteristics of species once the optimal body size has been accounted for. The model now correctly predicts an average of 73% of links. The key features of our approach are that latent traits quantify the structure that is left unexplained by the explanatory variable and that this quantification allows a test of whether independent biological information, such as microhabitat use, camouflage, or phylogeny, explains this structure. We illustrate this method with phylogeny and find that it is linked to one or both latent traits in nine of 12 food webs.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Extinction Cascades and Catastrophe in Ancient Food Webs;,citation_abstract=A model is developed to explore the potential responses of paleocommunities to disruptions of primary production during times of mass extinction and ecological crisis. Disruptions of primary production are expected to generate bottom-up cascades of secondary extinction, and these are predictable given species richnesses, functional diversity, and trophic link distributions. If, however, consumers are permitted to compensate for the loss of trophic resources by increasing the intensities of their remaining biotic interactions, top-down driven catastrophic increases of secondary extinction emerge from the model. Both bottom-up and top-down effects are themselves controlled by the geometry of the food webs. The general Phanerozoic trends of increasing taxonomic and ecological diversities, as well as the varying strengths of biotic interactions, have led to food webs of increasing complexity. The frequency of catastrophic secondary extinction increases as food web complexity increases, but increased complexity also serves to dampen the magnitude of the secondary extinctions. When intraguild competitive interactions are included in the model, competitively inferior taxa are observed to possess greater probabilities of survival if the guilds are embedded in simple subnetworks of the overall food web. The result is the emergence of post-extinction guilds dominated by those inferior taxa. These results are congruent with empirical observations of &amp;amp;amp;quot;disaster taxa&amp;quot; dominance after some mass extinction events, and provide a mechanism for the reorganization of ecosystems that is observed after those events. The model makes the testable prediction that dominance by disaster taxa, however, should be observed only when bottom-up disruptions have caused ecosystems to collapse catastrophically.;,citation_author=Peter D.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A framework for reconstructing ancient food webs using functional trait data;,citation_abstract=Food webs provide quantitative insights into the structure and dynamics of ecological communities. Previous work has shown their utility in understanding community responses to modern and ancient perturbations, including anthropogenic change and mass extinctions. However, few ancient food webs have been reconstructed due to difficulties assessing trophic interactions amongst extinct species derived from an incomplete fossil record. We present and assess the Paleo Food web Inference Model (PFIM). PFIM uses functional trait data–predictive of interactions in modern ecosystems and commonly available for fossil organisms–to reconstruct ancient food webs. We test the model by (i) applying it to four modern ecosystems with empirical constrained food webs to directly compare PFIM-constructed networks to their empirical counterparts, (ii) by carefully comparing discrepancies between PFIM-inferred and empirical webs in one of those systems, and (iii) by comparing networks describing feasible trophic interactions (&amp;amp;amp;quot;feasible webs&amp;quot;) with networks to which we superimpose characteristic interaction distributions derived from modern theory (&quot;realized webs&quot;). As a proof of concept, we then apply the method to faunal data from two Cambrian fossil deposits to reconstruct ancient trophic systems. PFIM-inferred feasible food webs successfully predict ~70% of trophic interactions across four modern systems. Furthermore, inferred food webs with enforced interaction distributions (i.e., realized webs) accurately predict ~90% of interactions. Comparisons with a global database of trophic interactions and other food web models, suggest that under sampling of empirical webs accounts for up to 21% of the remaining differences between PFIM and empirical food webs. Food webs can be reasonably approximated by inferring trophic interactions based upon life habit traits.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Quantitative Patterns in the Structure of Model and Empirical Food Webs;,citation_abstract=Understanding the structure of food webs, and the mechanisms that give rise to this structure, is one of the most challenging problems in ecology. We analyze from a statistical physics perspective the network structure of model food webs and of 15 community food webs from a variety of environments, including freshwater, marine, estuarine, and terrestrial environments. We perform a theoretical analysis of two recently proposed models for food webs, the niche model of R. J. Williams and N. D. Martinez and the nested-hierarchy model of M.-F. Cattin et al. We find that the two models generate distributions of numbers of prey, predators, and links that are described by the same analytical expressions. Our analytical treatment reveals that a model’s capacity to reproduce empirical data is principally determined by its ability to satisfy two conditions: (1) the species’ niche values form a totally ordered set and (2) each species has a specific exponentially decaying probability of preying on a given fraction of the species with lower niche values. To test this hypothesis, we generalize the cascade model of J. E. Cohen and C. M. Newman so that it satisfies condition 2 and find that the new model is able to reproduce the properties of empirical food webs, validating our hypothesis. We use our analytical predictions as a guide to the analysis of 15 of the most complete empirical food webs available. We demonstrate that the quantitative unifying patterns that describe the properties of the food-web models considered earlier also describe the majority of the empirical webs considered. We find good agreement between the empirical data and the models for the average distance between species and the average clustering coefficient. Our results strongly support two hypotheses: first, that any model satisfying the two conditions we identify will accurately reproduce a number of the statistical properties of empirical food webs, and second, that the empirical distributions of number of prey and number of predators follow universal functional forms that, without free parameters, match our analytical predictions.;,citation_author=D.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Food web reconstruction through phylogenetic transfer of low-rank network representation;,citation_abstract=Despite their importance in many ecological processes, collecting data and information on ecological interactions is an exceedingly challenging task. For this reason, large parts of the world have a data deficit when it comes to species interactions and how the resulting networks are structured. As data collection alone is unlikely to be sufficient, community ecologists must adopt predictive methods. We present a methodological framework that uses graph embedding and transfer learning to assemble a predicted list of trophic interactions of a species pool for which their interactions are unknown. Specifically, we “learn” the information (latent traits) of species from a known interaction network and infer the latent traits of another species pool for which we have no a priori interaction data based on their phylogenetic relatedness to species from the known network. The latent traits can then be used to predict interactions and construct an interaction network. Here we assembled a metaweb for Canadian mammals derived from interactions in the European food web, despite only 4% of common species being shared between the two locations. The results of the predictive model are compared against databases of recorded pairwise interactions, showing that we correctly recover 91% of known interactions. The framework itself is robust even when the known network is incomplete or contains spurious interactions making it an ideal candidate as a tool for filling gaps when it comes to species interactions.

Because metawebs are typically expressed at large spatial and taxonomic scales, assembling them is a tedious and costly process; predictive methods can help circumvent the limitations in data deficiencies, by providing a first approximation of metawebs. One way to improve our ability to predict metawebs is to maximize available information by using graph embeddings, as opposed to an exhaustive list of species interactions. Graph embedding is an emerging field in machine learning that holds great potential for ecological problems. Here, we outline how the challenges associated with inferring metawebs line-up with the advantages of graph embeddings; followed by a discussion as to how the choice of the species pool has consequences on the reconstructed network, specifically as to the role of human-made (or arbitrarily assigned) boundaries and how these may influence ecological hypotheses.;,citation_author=Tanya Strydom;,citation_author=Salomé Bouskila;,citation_author=Francis Banville;,citation_author=Ceres Barros;,citation_author=Dominique Caron;,citation_author=Maxwell J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A roadmap towards predicting species interaction networks (across space and time);,citation_abstract=Networks of species interactions underpin numerous ecosystem processes, but comprehensively sampling these interactions is difficult. Interactions intrinsically vary across space and time, and given the number of species that compose ecological communities, it can be tough to distinguish between a true negative (where two species never interact) from a false negative (where two species have not been observed interacting even though they actually do). Assessing the likelihood of interactions between species is an imperative for several fields of ecology. This means that to predict interactions between speciesand to describe the structure, variation, and change of the ecological networks they formwe need to rely on modelling tools. Here, we provide a proof-of-concept, where we show how a simple neural network model makes accurate predictions about species interactions given limited data. We then assess the challenges and opportunities associated with improving interaction predictions, and provide a conceptual roadmap forward towards predictive models of ecological networks that is explicitly spatial and temporal. We conclude with a brief primer on the relevant methods and tools needed to start building these models, which we hope will guide this research programme forward.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Inferring the mammal tree: Species-level sets of phylogenies for questions in ecology, evolution, and conservation;,citation_abstract=Big, time-scaled phylogenies are fundamental to connecting evolutionary processes to modern biodiversity patterns. Yet inferring reliable phylogenetic trees for thousands of species involves numerous trade-offs that have limited their utility to comparative biologists. To establish a robust evolutionary timescale for all approximately 6,000 living species of mammals, we developed credible sets of trees that capture root-to-tip uncertainty in topology and divergence times. Our “backbone-and-patch” approach to tree building applies a newly assembled 31-gene supermatrix to two levels of Bayesian inference: (1) backbone relationships and ages among major lineages, using fossil node or tip dating, and (2) species-level “patch” phylogenies with nonoverlapping in-groups that each correspond to one representative lineage in the backbone. Species unsampled for DNA are either excluded (“DNA-only” trees) or imputed within taxonomic constraints using branch lengths drawn from local birthdeath models (“completed” trees). Joining time-scaled patches to backbones results in species-level trees of extant Mammalia with all branches estimated under the same modeling framework, thereby facilitating rate comparisons among lineages as disparate as marsupials and placentals. We compare our phylogenetic trees to previous estimates of mammal-wide phylogeny and divergence times, finding that (1) node ages are broadly concordant among studies, and (2) recent (tip-level) rates of speciation are estimated more accurately in our study than in previous “supertree” approaches, in which unresolved nodes led to branch-length artifacts.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A bioenergetic framework for aboveground terrestrial food webs;,citation_abstract=Bioenergetic approaches have been greatly influential for understanding community functioning and stability and predicting effects of environmental changes on biodiversity. These approaches use allometric relationships to establish species’ trophic interactions and consumption rates and have been successfully applied to aquatic ecosystems. Terrestrial ecosystems, where body mass is less predictive of plantconsumer interactions, present inherent challenges that these models have yet to meet. Here, we discuss the processes governing terrestrial plantconsumer interactions and develop a bioenergetic framework integrating those processes. Our framework integrates bioenergetics specific to terrestrial plants and their consumers within a food web approach while also considering mutualistic interactions. Such a framework is poised to advance our understanding of terrestrial food webs and to predict their responses to environmental changes.;,citation_author=Fernanda S.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Simple rules yield complex food webs;,citation_abstract=Several of the most ambitious theories in ecology1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14 describe food webs that document the structure of strong and weak trophic links9 that is responsible for ecological dynamics among diverse assemblages of species4,11,12,13. Early mechanism-based theory asserted that food webs have little omnivory and several properties that are independent of species richness1,2,3,4,6. This theory was overturned by empirical studies that found food webs to be much more complex5,7,8,9,14,15,16,17,18, but these studies did not provide mechanistic explanations for the complexity9. Here we show that a remarkably simple model fills this scientific void by successfully predicting key structural properties of the most complex and comprehensive food webs in the primary literature. These properties include the fractions of species at top, intermediate and basal trophic levels, the means and variabilities of generality, vulnerability and food-chain length, and the degrees of cannibalism, omnivory, looping and trophic similarity. Using only two empirical parameters, species number and connectance, our “niche model” extends the existing “cascade model”3,19 and improves its fit ten-fold by constraining species to consume a contiguous sequence of prey in a one-dimensional trophic niche20.;,citation_author=Richard J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Success and its limits among structural models of complex food webs;,citation_abstract=1 Following the development of the relatively successful niche model, several other simple structural food web models have been proposed. These models predict the detailed structure of complex food webs given only two input parameters, the numbers of species and the number of feeding links among them. 2 The models claim different degrees of success but have not been compared consistently with each other or with the empirical data. We compared the performance of five structural models rigorously against 10 empirical food webs from a variety of aquatic and terrestrial habitats containing 2592 species and 68997 links. 3 All models include near-hierarchical ordering of species’ consumption and have identical distributions of the number of prey of each consumer species, but differ in the extent to which species’ diets are required to be contiguous and the rules used to assign feeding links. 4 The models perform similarly on a range of food-web properties, including the fraction of top, intermediate and basal species, the standard deviations of generality and connectivity and the fraction of herbivores and omnivores. 5 For other properties, including the standard deviation of vulnerability, the fraction of cannibals and species in loops, mean trophic level, path length, clustering coefficient, maximum similarity and diet discontinuity, there are significant differences in the performance of the different models. 6 While the empirical data do not support the niche model’s assumption of diet contiguity, models which relax this assumption all have worse overall performance than the niche model. All the models under-estimate severely the fraction of species that are herbivores and exhibit other important failures that need to be addressed in future research.;,citation_author=Richard J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=EltonTraits 1.0: Species-level foraging attributes of the world’s birds and mammals;,citation_abstract=Species are characterized by physiological, behavioral, and ecological attributes that are all subject to varying evolutionary and ecological constraints and jointly determine species’ role and function in ecosystems. Attributes such as diet, foraging strata, foraging time, and body size, in particular, characterize a large portion of the “Eltonian” niches of species. Here we present a global species-level compilation of these key attributes for all 9993 and 5400 extant bird and mammal species derived from key literature sources. Global handbooks and monographs allowed the consistent sourcing of attributes for most species. For diet and foraging stratum we followed a defined protocol to translate the verbal descriptions into standardized, semiquantitative information about relative importance of different categories. Together with body size (continuous) and activity time (categorical) this enables a much finer distinction of species’ foraging ecology than typical categorical guild assignments allow. Attributes lacking information for specific species are flagged, and interpolated values based on taxonomy are provided instead. The presented data set is limited by, among others, these select cases missing observed data, by errors and uncertainty in the expert assessment as presented in the literature, and by the lack of intraspecific information. However, the standardized and transparent nature and complete global coverage of the data set should support an array of potential studies in biogeography, community ecology, macroevolution, global change biology, and conservation. Potential uses include comparative work involving these traits as focal or secondary variables, ecological research on the trait or trophic structure of communities, or conservation science concerned with the loss of function among species or in ecosystems in a changing world. We hope that this publication will spur the sharing, collaborative curation, and extension of data to the benefit of a more integrative, rigorous, and global biodiversity science.;,citation_author=Hamish Wilman;,citation_author=Jonathan Belmaker;,citation_author=Jennifer Simpson;,citation_author=Carolina Rosa;,citation_author=Marcelo M.

<p>The standard run of the mill that we cannot always feasibly construct networks because 1. hard, 2. time (yay dinosaurs, but also the future and impending doom I guess), and 3. probably something else meaningful that’s just slipping my mind at the moment. Some of the usual culprits will come in here like: <span class="citation" data-cites="jordanoSamplingNetworksEcological2016">Jordano (<a href="#ref-jordanoSamplingNetworksEcological2016" role="doc-biblioref">2016b</a>)</span>; <span class="citation" data-cites="jordanoChasingEcologicalInteractions2016">(<a href="#ref-jordanoChasingEcologicalInteractions2016" role="doc-biblioref">Jordano 2016a</a>)</span>; <span class="citation" data-cites="poisotGlobalKnowledgeGaps2021">Poisot et al.

<p>Arguably the need for methods and tools for constructing interaction networks arises from two different (but still aligned) places of interest within the field of network ecology. On the one side of the spectrum sits the researcher who is interested in generating a set of ecologically plausible but not necessarily realised ‘in the field’ for the purpose of running further simulations (<em>e.g.,</em> extinction sim REF? <strong>TODO</strong>) or understanding some higher-level process (<em>e.g.,</em> energetics REF <strong>TODO</strong>). This researcher is contrasted by one that is interested in constructing real-world, location specific interactions networks in lieu of having access to data generated in the field (see <span class="citation" data-cites="strydomRoadmapPredictingSpecies2021">Strydom et al. (<a href="#ref-strydomRoadmapPredictingSpecies2021" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> for a discussion on this). Of course these two categories are not distinct, mutually exclusive, groups but can rather be viewed as operating on a gradient ranging from a need for generality (<em>something</em>) to a need for specificity (local-level predictions) when it comes to the quality(?) of the network that is constructed by a specific tool. Of course this research need would also reflected in the model development process itself and thus the idea of what a ‘good enough’ constructed network will be in the context of assessing the performance of a specific model.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="cohenStochasticTheoryCommunity1985">Joel E. Cohen, Newman, and Steele (<a href="#ref-cohenStochasticTheoryCommunity1985" role="doc-biblioref">1985</a>)</span> states that <em>“[Their] approach is more like gross anatomy than like physiology… that is, the gross anatomy is frozen, rather than in motion.”</em>.</p>
<p>Interestingly <span class="citation" data-cites="williamsSuccessItsLimits2008">Williams and Martinez (<a href="#ref-williamsSuccessItsLimits2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span> also explicitly talk about <em>structural</em> food-web models in their introduction… so how I see it that means that there has always been this inherent acknowledgement that models are function at a specific ‘network level’.</p>

<h4 data-number="1.1.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-history-behind-the-approach"><span class="header-section-number">1.1.2</span> The history behind the approach</h4>
<p>Maybe a brief history of the development of predictive tools/topo generators? Sort of where the theory/body of work was based and how that has changed? IS there a difference between topo generator and predictive tool - I’m inclined to think that it aligns with the whole debate of high level structure vs node-level perfection</p>
<p>Maybe start here with discussing the core mechanistic differences that models will work at — some are really concerned about (and thus constrained by) structure, others are more mechanistic in nature <em>i.e.,</em> species <em>a</em> has the capacity to eat species <em>b</em> because traits (read gob size), and then you get <span class="citation" data-cites="rohrModelingFoodWebs2010">Rohr et al. (<a href="#ref-rohrModelingFoodWebs2010" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="strydomFoodWebReconstruction2022">Strydom et al. (<a href="#ref-strydomFoodWebReconstruction2022" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> that sit in the weird liminal latent space…</p>
<p>Here I will probably get on my (newly discovered) soapbox and wax lyrical about how in certain situations structure is enough (and that will probably be for some high-level things like thinking about energy flows etc., I can also see a world in which maybe you want to do some sort of robustness/extinction work - since then you’re usually doing ‘random’ (within limits) extinctions) but there may be use cases where we are really interested in the node-level interactions <em>i.e.,</em> species identity is like a thing we need to care about and also be able to retrieve specific interactions at specific nodes correctly. What is the purpose of generating a network? Is it an element of a bigger question we are asking, <em>e.g.,</em> I want to generate a series of networks to do some extinction simulations/bioenergetic stuff OR are we looking for a ‘final product’ network that is relevant to a specific location? (this can still be broad in geographic scope).</p>
<p>At some point we are going to need to discuss the key differences and implications between predicting a metaweb (<em>sensu</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="dunneNetworkStructureFood2006">Jennifer A. Dunne (<a href="#ref-dunneNetworkStructureFood2006" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>)</span>) and a network realisation. And here I can’t help but think about <span class="citation" data-cites="poisotSpeciesWhyEcological2015">Poisot, Stouffer, and Gravel (<a href="#ref-poisotSpeciesWhyEcological2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span> (and probably other papers) that discuss how the local factors are going to play a role and even the same pair of species may interact differently in different points in the landscape.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Do we need to delve into individual-based networks? (<em>sensu</em> Tinker 2012, Araújo 2008) I think its probably a step too far and one starts creeping into apples and pears type of comparisons. Especially since these work off of already existing networks (I seem to recall) and its more about about ‘tweaking’ those - so not so much <em>de novo</em> predictions. Although this might be useful to keep in mind when it comes to re-wiring… Also on that note do we opn the re-wiring door here in this ms or wait it out a bit.</p>

<p><strong>Random model</strong> <span class="citation" data-cites="erdosRandomGraphs1959">(<a href="#ref-erdosRandomGraphs1959" role="doc-biblioref">Erdős and Rényi 1959</a>)</span>: Links are assembled randomly, not developed within an ecological framework. But of course could still hold if we assume that communities are randomly assembled in terms of who is interacting with who (I seem to think that’s sort of what May was arguing but I would need to remind myself)</p>
<p><strong>Cascade model</strong> <span class="citation" data-cites="cohenCommunityFoodWebs1990">(<a href="#ref-cohenCommunityFoodWebs1990" role="doc-biblioref">Joel E. Cohen, Briand, and Newman 1990</a>)</span>: Much like the name suggests the cascade model rests on the idea that species feed on one another in a hierarchical manner. This rests on the assumption that the links within a network are variably distributed across the network; with the proportion of links decreasing as one moves up the trophic levels (<em>i.e.,</em> ‘many’ prey and ‘few’ predators). This is achieved by assigning all species a random rank, this rank will then determine both the predators and prey of that species. A species will have a particular probability of being fed on by any species with a higher ranking than it, this probability is constrained by the specified connectance of the network. Interestingly here ‘species’ are treated as any individual that consume and are consumed by the same ‘species’, <em>i.e.,</em> these are not taxonomical species <span class="citation" data-cites="cohenStochasticTheoryCommunity1985">(<a href="#ref-cohenStochasticTheoryCommunity1985" role="doc-biblioref">Joel E. Cohen, Newman, and Steele 1985</a>)</span>.

<p><strong>Niche model</strong> <span class="citation" data-cites="williamsSimpleRulesYield2000">(<a href="#ref-williamsSimpleRulesYield2000" role="doc-biblioref">Williams and Martinez 2000</a>)</span>: The niche model introduces the idea that species interactions are based on the ‘feeding niche’ of a species. Broadly, all species are randomly assigned a ‘feeding niche’ range and all species that fall in this range can be consumed by that species (thereby allowing for cannibalism). The niche of each species is randomly assigned and the range of each species’ niche is (in part) constrained by the specified connectance of the network. The niche model has also been modified, although it appears that adding to the ‘complexity’ of the niche model does not improve on its ability to generate a more ecologically ‘correct’ network <span class="citation" data-cites="williamsSuccessItsLimits2008">(<a href="#ref-williamsSuccessItsLimits2008" role="doc-biblioref">Williams and Martinez 2008</a>)</span>.</p>

Here specifically the embedding is preformed on a known interaction network and captures information as to where species (nodes) are positioned in a network <em>e.g.,</em> are they basal prey species or top predators, similar to the log ratio model.

<p>Here I think we need to span a variety of domains, at minimum aquatic and terrestrial but maybe there should be a ‘scale’ element as well <em>i.e.,</em> a regional and local network. I think there is going to be a ‘turning point’ where structural will take over from mechanistic in terms of performance. More specifically at local scales bioenergetic constraints (and co-occurrence) may play a bigger role in structuring a network whereas at the metaweb level then mechanistic may make more (since by default its about who can potentially interact and obviously not constrained by real-world scenarios) <em>sensu</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="caronTrophicInteractionModels2023">Caron et al. (<a href="#ref-caronTrophicInteractionModels2023" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a>)</span>. Although having said that I feel that contradicts the idea of backbones (<em>sensu</em> Bramon Mora (sp?) et al &amp; Stouffer et al) But that might be where we get the idea of core <em>structure</em> vs something like linkage density. So core things like trophic level/chain length will be conserved but connectance might not (I think I understand what I’m trying to say here)</p>
<p>I think we should also use the Dunne (I think) Cambrian (also think) network (I was correct and its this one <span class="citation" data-cites="dunneCompilationNetworkAnalyses2008">Jennifer A. Dunne et al. (<a href="#ref-dunneCompilationNetworkAnalyses2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span>). Because 1) it gives the paleo-centric methods their moment in the sun and 2) I think it also brings up the interesting question of can we use modern structure to predict past ones? Here one might expect a more mechanistic approach to shine.</p>

<p>I think a big take home will (hopefully) be how different approaches do better in different situations and so you as an end user need to take this into consideration and pick accordingly. I think <span class="citation" data-cites="petcheyFitEfficiencyBiology2011">Petchey et al. (<a href="#ref-petcheyFitEfficiencyBiology2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span> might have (and share) some thoughts on this (thanks Andrew). I feel like I need to look at <span class="citation" data-cites="berlowGoldilocksFactorFood2008">Berlow, Brose, and Martinez (<a href="#ref-berlowGoldilocksFactorFood2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span> but maybe not exactly in this context but vaguely adjacent.</p>
<p>An interesting thing to also think about (and arguably it will be addressed based on some of the other thoughts and ideas) is data dependant and data independent ‘parametrisation’ of the models…</p>
<p>I probably think about this point too much but a point of discussion that I think will be interesting to bring up the idea that if a model is missing a specific pairwise link but doing well at the structural level then when does it matter? I think this is covered with the whole node vs graph level performance but I kind of just want to bring it up here again because also one of those things that I think about a bit too much probably…</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Thinking very long term here and maybe a bit beyond the scope but also thinking about a multi- model approach? So in other words using one model to build an initial network but maybe a second one to constrain it a bit better. I blame this thought on the over-connected PFIM food webs…</p>
