abstract: |
  Food webs are a useful abstraction and representation of the feeding links between species in a community and are used to infer many ecosystem level processes. However, the different theories, mechanisms, and criteria that underpin how a food web is defined, and ultimately, constructed means that not all food webs are representing the same ecological process at the same scale. Here we present a synthesis of the different assumptions, scales, and mechanisms that are used to define the different ecological networks , leading to a revision of definitions for different types of networks. Additionally we explicitly link the different network representations to the broader methodological approaches (models) that are used to construct them. In explicitly outlining the assumptions, scales, and mechanisms of network inference allows for a formal categorisation of how to use networks to answer key ecological and conservation questions as wel as defining clear guidelines to prevent unintentional misuse or misinterpretation.

At the heart of modern biodiversity science are a set of concepts and theories about biodiversity, stability, and function [@loreauBiodiversityEcosystemStability2013]. These relate to the abundance, distribution, and services that biodiversity provides, and how biodiversity – as an interconnected set of species – responds to multiple stressors. Documenting interactions between and among species is thus one of the fundamental building blocks of community ecology, providing a powerful abstraction and platform for mathematical and statistical modelling of biodiversity in order to make predictions, mitigate threats, and manage services [@windsorUsingEcologicalNetworks2023]. Such network representations of biodiversity are increasingly argued to be an asset to understanding and predicting the abundance, distribution, dynamics, and services provided by multiple species facing multiple stressors. However, there is a growing discourse around limitations to the interpretation and applied use of networks [@dormannRisePossibleFall2023; @bluthgenWhyNetworkAnalysis2010], primarily as the result of shortcomings regarding their conceptualisation [@bluthgenCriticalEvaluationNetwork2024].

Because an 'interaction network' can be defined and conceptualised in many ways, each method will be embed different assumptions about the determinants of interactions, and characterise patterns and process at different scales, which will ultimately influence the nature and scope of inference [@proulxNetworkThinkingEcology2005]. The different ways in which a network can be represented is the result of *how* the network is constructed, which represents an intersection of the data used to construct the network and the underlying theory as to what drives the occurrence of interactions between species. Although there have been extensive discussions as to the the challenges relating to the scale and nature of data collection/observation [*e.g.,* @bluthgenCriticalEvaluationNetwork2024; @brimacombeShortcomingsReusingSpecies2023; @moulatletScalingTrophicSpecialization2024; @pringleResolvingFoodWebStructure2020; @polisComplexTrophicInteractions1991; @saberskiImpactDataResolution2024] we still lack a clear framework as to how different data sources result in networks that are fundamentally different [@sec-representation]. 

In this perspective we aim to provide an overview of the different **food web** representations, particularly how these relate to the terminology used to define a food web, and how this is influenced by both the processes that determine interactions [@sec-process], as well as how this relates to the way in which we construct the resulting networks [@sec-construct]. This allows us to deliver an overview of fundamental questions in ecology that we think can benefit from network thinking and a proposal that such thinking can accelerate our capacity to predict the impact of multiple stressors on biodiverse communities. Specifically, we finish this perspective with an overview of fundamental questions in ecology that we think can benefit from network thinking and a proposal that such thinking can accelerate our capacity to predict the impact of change on biodiverse communities.

# Setting the Scene: The Not So Basics of Nodes and Edges {#sec-anatomy}

Defining a food web seems simple; it is the representation of feeding interactions (edges) between species (nodes) in the form of a network. However, the definition of 'edges' and 'nodes', as well as the levels of organization at which they are aggregated can take many forms [@poisotDescribeUnderstandPredict2016, @moulatletScalingTrophicSpecialization2024], ultimately encoding a series of assumptions and criteria within a network. An awareness of variance in the way a food web can be defined is critical as a network (or its adjacency matrix) is both the 'object' from which inferences are made (*e.g.,* the interactions between species, or how the structure influences ecosystem level processes) as well as the 'product' of either the data collection [@brimacombeShortcomingsReusingSpecies2023] a prediction process [@banvilleDecipheringProbabilisticSpecies2024], or both, and is an object form which downstream (*e.g.,* responses to stressors, dynamics or mapping structure to ecosystem level processes). One thus needs to be aware of both the criteria that define nodes and edges and the scale of the processes or mechanisms that define the collecting of species together.

## How do we define a node?

Although this may seem an elementary question in the context of food webs --- a node *should* represent a (taxonomic) species, the reality is that nodes can often represent non-taxonomic units such as trophic species [*e.g.,* @yodzisCompartmentationRealAssembled1982; @williamsSimpleRulesYield2000], feeding guild [*e.g.,* @garcia-callejasNonrandomInteractionsGuilds2023], or segregation of species by life stages [*e.g.,* @cleggImpactIntraspecificVariation2018]. Practical implications of how we are aggregating the nodes is that the resolution may not always be 'pixel perfect', and may even vary within a single network. Such granularity and variation can limit the ability to make (taxonomic) species specific inferences (*e.g.,* does species $a$ eat species $b$?), and affect downstream inference made from networks, including estimates of complexity and structure [@beckermanForagingBiologyPredicts2006; @cleggImpactIntraspecificVariation2018]. There may also be value in having nodes that represent an aggregation of species, as the distribution of the links between them may be more meaningful in terms of understanding energy flow and distribution within the system.

## What is captured by an edge?

At its core, links within food webs can be thought of as a representation of either feeding links between species (be that realised or potential [@dunneNetworkStructureFood2006; @pringleUntanglingFoodWebs2020]), or fluxes within a system *e.g.,* energy transfer or material flow as the result of the feeding links between species [@lindemanTrophicDynamicAspectEcology1942]. These correspond with different 'currencies' (the feasibility of links or the energy that is moving between nodes). How these links are specified will influence the resulting structure of the network. For example, taking a food web that consists of links representing all *potential* feeding links for a community will be meaningless if one is interested in understanding the flow of energy through the network as the links are not environmentally/energetically constrained. In addition to the various ways of defining the links between species pairs there are also a myriad of ways in which the links themselves can be quantified. Links between species are often treated as being present or absent (*i.e.,* binary) but it is also possible to use probabilities [which quantifies how likely an interaction is to occur, @poisotStructureProbabilisticNetworks2016; @banvilleDecipheringProbabilisticSpecies2024] or continuous measurements [which quantifies the strength of of an interaction, @berlowInteractionStrengthsFood2004].

## Network representations {#sec-representation}

Networks can be thought of to fall into two different 'types'; namely metawebs; traditionally defined as all of the *potential* interactions for a specific species pool [@dunneNetworkStructureFood2006], and realised networks; which is the subset of interactions in a metaweb that are *realised* for a specific community at a given time and place. The fundamental differences between these two network representations are the spatial scale at which they are constructed, and the associated processes that are assumed to drive pattern at these scales. 

A metaweb provides insight as to the viability (feasibility) of an interaction between two species occurring, and captures some measure of the viability/feasibility of an interaction occurring between two species based on 1) the complementarity of their traits (a *global metaweb*) and 2) can be further refined by their co-occurrence (a *regional metaweb*). Metawebs thus provide a means to identify links that are not ecologically plausible, *i.e.,* forbidden links [@jordanoSamplingNetworksEcological2016], or provide an idea of the *complete* diet of a species [@strydomGraphEmbeddingTransfer2023].

In contrast realised networks are relatively localised in space and time, and the links between species are contingent on both the co-occurrence of species, the role of the environment, and mechanisms of diet choice. Fundamentally this means that the presence/absence of a link is the result of the 'behaviour' of the species.

Ultimately this means that a metaweb and a realised network are different; links that are absent in a metaweb can (conceptually although not always practically) be treated as being truly absent, however links that are absent in a realised network cannot be considered to be truly absent but rather as absent due to the broader environmental/community context. Importantly, a realised network is *not* simply the downscaling of a metaweb to a smaller scale (*e.g.,* moving from the country to the 1x1 km^2^ scale based on fine-scale species co-occurrence) but rather represents a shift towards capturing the higher level processes that determine the *realisation* of an interaction, *i.e.,* the definition of an edges shifts from being determined by interaction feasibility to that of energetic choices/consequences. Thus, different network representations are determined and constrained by different sets of assumptions as to what the processes are that determine the presence/absence of an interaction between two species and will result in networks that are structurally different even if they contain the same species [@caronTraitmatchingModelsPredict2024].

# From Nodes and Edges to Process and Constraints {#sec-process}

In the previous section we discussed how the nuances in defining a network (in terms of nodes, edges, and representation as a network) are broadly capturing different processes. Here we expand this discussion, introducing five core constraints that determine the links among species  [@fig-process]. The scale at which they operate leads to clear articulation of global metawebs as networks of all possible interactions for a collection of species, regional metawebs as networks representing all possible interactions of co-occurring species and realised networks representing interactions that occur and are framed by some kind of energetic constraint.  We further develop these concepts in @sec-construct, where we will contextualise these process within the different bodies of theory as well as the set of tools and data required to construct the appropriate network, which will ultimately determine the context in which the resulting network is used [@sec-progress].

The five core constraints we propose are evolutionary compatibility, co-occurrence, abundance, diet choice, and non-trophic interactions. In the following sections, we present details about how the constraints are defined, the scale at which they operate and how they deliver a network.

![Aligning the various processes that determine interactions (right column) with the different network representations (left column). First we start with a **global metaweb** this network captures all possible interactions for a collection of species in the global context. However within the global environment different species occur in different regions (region one = yellow and region 2 = orange), and it is possible to construct two different metawebs (**regional metawebs**) for each region by taking accounting for the co-occurrence patterns of the difference species - as shown here we have two regions with some species (blue) that are found in both regions and others endemic to either region one (yellow) or region two (orange). However even within a region we do not expect that all interactions to be realised but rather that there are multiple configurations of the regional metaweb over both space and time. The 'state' of the different **realised networks** are ultimately influenced not just by the co-occurrence of a species pair but rather the larger community context such as the abundance of different species, maximisation of energy gain, or indirect/higher order interactions.](images/anatomy.png){#fig-process}

## Processes that determine the feasibility of an interaction {#sec-process-feasibility}

Here we will look at processes that 'act' at the species pair of interest, that is the *possibility* of an interaction being present/absent is assessed at the pairwise level and one is left with a 'list' of interactions that are present/absent. Although it is possible to build a network (*i.e.,* metaweb) from this information it is important to be aware that the structure of this network is not constrained by real-world dynamics or conditions (*i.e.,* the community context), and so just because species are able to interact does not mean that they will [@poisotSpeciesWhyEcological2015].

**Evolutionary compatibility**

This constraint is defined by shared (co)evolutionary history between consumers and resources [@segarRoleEvolutionShaping2020; @gomezEcologicalInteractionsAre2010; @dallarivaExploringEvolutionarySignature2016] which, in the more proximal sense, is manifested as 'trait complementarity' between two species [@benadiQuantitativePredictionInteractions2022]. In this body of theory, one species (the consumer) has the 'correct' (multivariate) set of traits that allow it to chase, capture, kill, and consume the other species (the resource) and interactions that are not compatible are defined as forbidden links [@jordanoSamplingNetworksEcological2016]; i.e., not physically possible and will *always* be absent within a network.

Networks arising from this constraint can be binary (possible vs forbidden) or probabilistic [@banvilleDecipheringProbabilisticSpecies2024], *e.g.,* the metaweb constructed by @strydomFoodWebReconstruction2022 uses probabilities to quantify their confidence with regards to the possibility of a specific interaction existing between two species. A network constructed on the basis of evolutionary compatibility is conceptually aligned with a 'global metaweb', and gives us information as to the feasibility of links between species despite the fact that they do not co-occur [as shown in @fig-process by the yellow and orange species].

**(Co)occurrence**

The co-occurrence of species in both time and space is a fundamental requirement for an interaction between two species to occur (at least in terms of feeding links). Although co-occurrence data alone is insufficient for building an accurate and ecologically meaningful representation of *feeding links* [@blanchetCooccurrenceNotEvidence2020], it is still a critical process that determines the realisation of a feeding link and allows us to spatially constrain a global metaweb based on local communities [@dansereauSpatiallyExplicitPredictions2024], in the context of @fig-process this would be the metawebs for regions one and two. 

## Processes that modify the behaviour (preference) of species {#sec-process-realisation}

Here we will showcase three processes that will ultimately influence the realisation of an interaction between species and form the conceptual basis for realised networks. As we show in @fig-process a 'truly realised' network is the product of different facets of both the properties of the community (**abundance** and **non-trophic interactions**) as well as the individual (**profitability**). This represents a contextual shift where the presence (realisation) of an interaction is no longer constrained to evaluating the viability between a *pair* of species but rather takes into consideration information about the community and the individual [@quinteroDownscalingMutualisticNetworks2024], and as discussed in @sec-representation, links are now *constrained* by consumer choice.

**Abundance**

The most basic abundance constraint linked to foraging biology is the principle that organisms feeding randomly will consume resources in proportion to their abundance [@stephensForagingTheory1986], and interactions are not necessarily contingent on there being any **compatibility** between them [@canardEmergenceStructuralPatterns2012; @momalTreebasedInferenceSpecies2020; @pomeranzInferringPredatorPrey2019]. However, a more ecologically sound assumption would be that the abundance of different prey species will influence the distribution of links in a network [@vazquezUnitingPatternProcess2009], by influencing which prey are targeted or preferred by the predator, as abundance influences factors such as the likelihood of two species (individuals) meeting [@poisotSpeciesWhyEcological2015; @banvilleDecipheringProbabilisticSpecies2024]. Thus, if abundance data are combined with a derived metaweb, there is a rule-set that defines the distribution and potentially strength (preference via abundance) of links and thus delivers structure.

**Profitability**

Ultimately, consumer choice is underpinned by the energetic cost-benefit (profitability) of trying to find, catch, kill, and consume a resource (where a consumer will optimise energy intake while minimising handling and search time (energy cost)). Although energetic constrains can be invoked in a myriad of ways [*e.g.,* @pawarDimensionalityConsumerSearch2012; @portalierMechanicsPredatorPrey2019; @cherifEnvironmentRescueCan2024] profitability represents a well described within both optimal foraging [@pykeOptimalForagingTheory1984] and metabolic theory [@brownMetabolicTheoryEcology2004], making it a good 'umbrella concept' for capturing the energetic cost of interactions.

**Non-trophic interactions**

Perhaps not as intuitive when thinking about the processes that determine feeding links is non-trophic interactions [@ingsEcologicalNetworksbeyondFood2009], specifically accounting for their ability to modify either the realisation or strength of trophic interactions [@golubskiModifyingModifiersWhat2011; @pilosofMultilayerNatureEcological2017; @staniczenkoStructuralDynamicsRobustness2010; @kamaruDisruptionAntplantMutualism2024]. Non-trophic interactions can modify interactions either 'directly' *e.g.,* predator *a* outcompetes predator *b* or 'indirectly' *e.g.,* mutualistic/facilitative interactions will alter the fine-scale distribution and abundance of species as well as their persistence [@kefiMoreMealIntegrating2012; @kefiNetworkStructureFood2015; @bucheMultitrophicHigherOrderInteractions2024].

# Linking theory to network construction: a case for models {#sec-construct}

The suite of different network representations [@sec-representation] that we have at our disposal allow us to isolate and operate within one (or a few) of the constraints discussed in @sec-process, and have an influence on the way we construct networks, specifically in terms of the development of different models. The act of constructing a 'real world' network through the empirical collection of interaction data is both costly and challenging to execute [@jordanoChasingEcologicalInteractions2016; @jordanoSamplingNetworksEcological2016], thus we often turn to models to either predict networks (be that the interaction between two species, or network structure [@strydomRoadmapPredictingSpecies2021]), identify missing interactions (gap fill) within an existing empirical dataset [*e.g.,* @bitonInductiveLinkPrediction2024; @stockPairwiseLearningPredicting2021; @dallasPredictingCrypticLinks2017]. In the context of this discussion food web models are also a valuable to that will allow us to better understand the different constraints determining interactions [@stoufferAllEcologicalModels2019; @songRigorousValidationEcological2024], allowing us to interrogate, generate, and reflect upon different ecological theories.

Here we will present the broader bodies of theory that have underpinned the development of different food web models, specifically in terms of understanding what drives the presence of interactions between species. Broadly we can think of interactions being 'stochastic', determined by the feasibility of traits (*sensu* @sec-process-feasibility), and more broadly the behaviour and dynamics of biological systems (*sensu* @sec-process-realisation). Each of these categories have their own set of accompanying theories and modelling approaches that have been developed within them and mapping these out is beneficial for two reasons 1) it is critical that the 'correct' network (and thus underlying models and assumptions) are used if we truly want to understand how different processes determine interactions [@estayEditorialPatternsProcesses2023; @moulatletScalingTrophicSpecialization2024; @saberskiImpactDataResolution2024; @saraviaEcologicalNetworkAssembly2022] and constructively move the field forward, and 2) provide guidance as to the identifying the appropriate networks for different research questions [@petcheyFitEfficiencyBiology2011, see also @sec-progress and Box 1].

::: {#box-hypothetical .callout-note}
# Box 1 - Why we need to aggregate networks at different scales: A hypothetical case study {.unnumbered}

Although it might seem most prudent to be predicting, constructing, and defining networks that are the closest representation of reality there are pros and cons of constructing both realised networks as well as metawebs. Let us take for example a community that experiences a degree of species turnover between seasons. In this community we expect species to be either present or absent depending on the season (*i.e.,* changes in co-occurrence) as well as some species exhibiting seasonal shifts in their diets (be that due to changes in species occurrence or predator choice). If one were to construct a metaweb that disregards these season shifts (*i.e.,* a global metaweb) it is clear that these finer nuances would be lost. It is of course possible to construct either smaller metawebs for the different seasonal communities (thereby capturing the changes in community diversity), or realised networks for each season (to capture diet or ecosystem process shifts *e.g.,* @schwarzTemporalScaledependencePlant2020). However, these small-scale networks lack the context of the bigger picture that is available at the metaweb - that is it gives us a more holistic idea of the entire diet range of a specific species, which is important when one needs to make conservation-based/applied decisions (*e.g.,* conserving the entire diet of a species and not just seasonal prey items) as well as providing information on interactions that may be possible regardless of the environmental/community context (species may have the capacity to consume certain prey items but do not do so due to local conditions). With this is mind let us see how the different network aggregations can be used: 

**1. A 'global' metaweb:** Knowledge of the entire diet breadth of a species is valuable especially in terms of understanding how a species will respond to changes in the community - *e.g.* invasions/rewilding scenarios (where does the new species 'fit' within the network?) as well as potential capacity to shift its diet. There is also the argument that a metaweb will allow us to identify species that act as links across the landscape.

**2. A seasonal metaweb:** Knowledge at the finer scale is also valuable to understand and provide insight on the differences in diets between seasons (and identify key species within the network in different environments). 

**3. A realised network:** Provide insight as to the different network configurations for a given time and place, which is a better approximation of the energy flows/ecosystem processes as they are occurring (that is the *structure* of the network is also meaningful). A realised network will also allow one to detect more nuanced shifts diet - *i.e.,* not only changes in links due to species turnover between seasons.
:::

## Stochastic networks

Within stochastic networks the assumption is that the interactions between species occurs irrespective of the identity of the species (*i.e.,* species have no agency) and links are *randomly* distributed throughout the network. Alternatively it can be assumed that interactions are still independent of a species' trait but are rater driven by its abundance, *sensu* neutral theory [@hubbellUnifiedNeutralTheory2001].

Practically there is little support that networks are truly stochastic, however null models [*e.g.,* @fortunaHabitatLossStructure2006; @bascompteNestedAssemblyPlantanimal2003] are often used as a 'null hypothesis' that can be used to ask questions about deviations in observed network structure [*e.g.,* @banvilleWhatConstrainsFood2023; @strydomSVDEntropyReveals2021]. Conversely, neutral models [@canardEmpiricalEvaluationNeutral2014; @krishnaNeutralnicheTheoryNestedness2008], and by extension processes, are most likely relevant at local scales [@pomeranzInferringPredatorPrey2019], *i.e.,* should be considered to play a role when constructing realised networks but are superseded by trait-based processes.

## Feasibility networks (metawebs)

Metawebs (depending on the aggregation) can help us develop our understanding of the intersection of species interactions and their co-occurrence [*sensu* a fusion of the the Eltonian (interactions) and Grinnellian (environmental) niches, @soberonGrinnellianEltonianNiches2007; @gravelBringingEltonGrinnell2019]. Whereby a *global metaweb* presents an approximation of the fundamental Eltonian niche of a species (*i.e.,* its relation to its food source), whereas as *regional metawebs* represent an intersection of Elton and Grinnell. As discussed in @sec-process-feasibility the feasibility of an interaction is typically assessed on a pairwise basis, and is often assessed based on the idea that interactions are governed by a set of 'feeding rules' [@morales-castillaInferringBioticInteractions2015], and are broadly elucidated in two different ways; *mechanistic models*, [*e.g.,* @shawFrameworkReconstructingAncient2024; @dunneCompilationNetworkAnalyses2008; @roopnarineEcologicalModellingPaleocommunity2017] and *pattern finding models* [*e.g.,* @strydomGraphEmbeddingTransfer2023; @pichlerMachineLearningAlgorithms2020; @strydomFoodWebReconstruction2022; @caronAddressingEltonianShortfall2022; @llewelynPredictingPredatorPrey2023; @desjardins-proulxEcologicalInteractionsNetflix2017; @eklofSecondaryExtinctionsFood2013; @cirtwillQuantitativeFrameworkInvestigating2019]. The fundamental difference between these two model groups is that *mechanistic models* rely on expert knowledge and make explicit assumptions on trait-feeding relationships, whereas the *pattern finding models* are dependent on existing interaction datasets from feeding rules can be elucidated.

Feasibility networks are useful for determining all feasible interactions for a specific community, and the models that have been developed in this context have the potential to allow us to construct first draft networks for communities for which we have no interaction data [@strydomFoodWebReconstruction2022], and are valuable not only in data poor regions but also for predicting interactions for 'unobservable' communities *e.g.,* prehistoric networks [@yeakelCollapseEcologicalNetwork2014; @frickeCollapseTerrestrialMammal2022; @dunhillExtinctionCascadesCommunity2024] or future, novel community assemblages. Additionally, an understanding of the Eltonian and Grinnellian niches of species has allowed us to better determine the distribution of a species by accounting not only for the role of the environment but also the role of species interactions [@higinoMismatchIUCNRange2023; @pollockUnderstandingCooccurrenceModelling2014].

## 'Behavioural' networks

Ultimately realised networks and capture some aspect of how the behavior of a species determines if a link is realised or not and can be modelled in two ways; models that predict realised interactions (whereby he behaiour of a secies is modelled *i.e.,* its diet choice), and models that predict the structure of realised networks (whereby the behvaiour of the system is modelled and assumptions are made with regards to the structure of a network).  In terms predicting interactions current models are rooted in feeding theory and allocate the links between species based on energy *e.g.,* diet models [@beckermanForagingBiologyPredicts2006; @petcheySizeForagingFood2008] have been used construct networks based on both profitability (as determined by the handling time, energy content, and predator attack rate) as well as abundance (prey density), and modular  models [@woottonModularTheoryTrophic2023; @krauseCompartmentsRevealedFoodweb2003] are based on the compartmentation and aquisition of energy for species at different trophic levels. Models that determine structure are based on the idea that networks follow a trophic hierarchy and that network structure can be determined by distributing interactions along single dimension [the “niche axis”; @allesinaGeneralModelFood2008], while parametrising an aspect of the network structure (although see @allesinaFoodWebModels2009 for a parameter-free model).

As behavioural networks are are build on the concept of dynamic processes (*e.g.,* the abundance of species will always be in flux) these networks are valuable for understanding the behaviour of networks over time or their response to change [@lajaaitiEcologicalNetworksDynamicsJlJulia2024; @delmasSimulationsBiomassDynamics2017; @curtsdotterEcosystemFunctionPredator2019]. However, they are 'costly' to construct (requiring data about the entire community, as it is the behaviour of the system that determines the behaviour of the part) and also lack the larger diet niche context afforded by metawebs. Structural models provide a data-light (the models often only require species richness) but assumption heavy (the resulting network structure is determined by an assumption of network structure) alternative, however they do not make species specific predictions and so cannot be used to determine if an interaction is either possible *or* realised between two species (*i.e.,* one cannot use these models to determine if species $a$ eats species $b$). Although this means this suite of models are unsuitable as tools for predicting species-specific interactions, they have been shown to be sufficient tools to predict the structure of networks [@williamsSuccessItsLimits2008], and provide a data-light (the models often only require species richness) but assumption heavy (the resulting network structure is determined by an assumption of network structure) way to construct a network.

# Making Progress with Networks {#sec-progress}

## Further development of models and tools

There has been a suite of models that have been developed to predict feeding links, however we are lacking in tools that are explicitly taking into consideration estimating both the feasibility as well as realisation of links, *i.e.,* both interactions and structure simultaneously [@strydomRoadmapPredictingSpecies2021]. This could be addressed either through the development of tools that do both (predict both interactions and structure), or to develop an ensemble modelling approach [@beckerOptimisingPredictiveModels2022; @terryFindingMissingLinks2020] or tools that will allow for the downsampling of metawebs into realised networks [*e.g.,* @roopnarineExtinctionCascadesCatastrophe2006]. Additionally, although realised networks are more closely aligned with *explicitly* capturing interaction strength we lack models that allow us to quantify this [@wellsSpeciesInteractionsEstimating2013; @strydomRoadmapPredictingSpecies2021]. In addition to the more intentional development of models we also need to consider the validation of these models, there have been developments and discussions for assessing how well a model recovers pairwise interactions [@strydomRoadmapPredictingSpecies2021; @poisotGuidelinesPredictionSpecies2023], although their are still challenges related to the completeness of the datasets that are to be used for validation, specifically the challenge of dealing with false-negatives [@catchenMissingLinkDiscerning2023]. In terms of validating the predicted structure of networks, we still lack clear set of guidelines for benchmarking the ability of models to recover structure [@allesinaGeneralModelFood2008].

## Making use of the different network representations

It should be clear that there is a high degree of interrelatedness and overlap between the way in which a network is constructed (modelled or predicted) and the process(es) that it captures [@fig-process], these are encoded (embedded) within the network representation and ultimately influences how the network can and should be used [@petcheyFitEfficiencyBiology2011; @berlowGoldilocksFactorFood2008], with different network representations yielding different interpretations of processes [@keyesSynthesisingRelationshipsFood2024]. It is probably both this nuance as well as a lack of clear boundaries and guidelines as to the links between network form and function [although see @delmasAnalysingEcologicalNetworks2019] that has stifled the 'productive use' of networks beyond the inventorying the interactions between species. Although progress with using networks as a means to address questions within larger bodies of ecological theory *e.g.,* invasion biology [@huiHowInvadeEcological2019] and co-existence theory [@garcia-callejasNonrandomInteractionsGuilds2023] has been made we still lack explicit guidelines as to what the appropriate network representation for the task at hand would be, and as highlighted in Box 1, underscores the need to evaluate exactly what process a specific network representation captures as well as its suitability for the question of interest. In @fig-future we present a mapping of what we believe are some of the key questions for which interaction networks can be used to the different networks representations that are most suitable, as well as highlight some of the methodological challenges that still need to be improved upon.

Necessary to move to predicting changes in biodiversity per se, ecosystem functions and identifying sensitive and robust species and portions of communities.
2.	How will novel communities interact? Here we can talk about the effects of range shifts and invasions and how this will result in new/novel community assemblages. And then also the intentional changes of species compositions through rewilding.
3.	Does rewiring happen and does it deliver robustness? Specific sub points to consider here is persistence, especially persistence to perturbation. Again, dynamic networks and network/community assembly and finally extinctions [@dunhillExtinctionCascadesCommunity2024].
4.	When do invasive species enhance or decimate communities?  When do reintroductions work?  [@woosterAustraliasRecentlyEstablished2024]
5.	Are there temperature threshold to community collapse
6.	Can socioeconomic networks combined with biological networks drive understanding of externalities?
7.	Can paleoecological data from deep time hyperthermal events provide sufficient insight into the targets, pace and recovery times from rapid climate events?

![Here we highlight some of the outstanding questions in both network as well as general ecology, as well as some of the outstanding methodological challenges with regards to constructing food webs (shown in orange) that we are faced with.](images/NetworkFuture.png){#fig-future}

| Question (broad) | Question (specific) | Network representation |
|------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| Species invasions | What species will the invading species interact with? | Regional metaweb but need to derive information from a global metaweb since these are interactions that are 'novel' |
| Species invasions | How does the invading species alter network dynamics and function? | Realised network (after having moved through the global metaweb to understand which interactions are feasible) |
| Range shifts and novel communities | Under global change how will novel community assemblages interact? | Global metaweb, need context of broader community |
| Extinctions | Cascading effect of the loss of a species from the network | Regional metaweb - need to account for entire diet, a realised network will exclude the entire diet but will allow to elucidate the final structure |
| Species/community persistence | Dynamics over time. Stability/resilience. How does a change in pop *A* affect pop *B*? | Realised networks - but dynamic! |
| Synthetic networks | Creating ecologically plausible communities for synthetic analyses | Structural networks - data light! |
| Practical use | What is both attainable (data constraints) but also of practical use to 'real world' decision making. So moving from theory to applied | ??Regional metawebs?? |

: This table represents an alternative approach to try and think about mapping questions to the different network representations.

# Concluding remarks

Having a clear understanding of the interplay between network representations and the processes that they are capable of encoding is critical if we are to understand exactly which networks can be used to answer which questions. As we highlight in Box 1 the different network representations have different potential uses and it should be clear that there is no 'best' network representation but rather a network representation that is best suited to its intended purpose. In providing a formalisation regards to the assumptions, scales, and mechanisms that need to be explicitly taken into consideration when deciding to use (and construct) networks we hope to prevent the unintentional misuse or misinterpretation of networks as well as provide a starting point from which we can develop a better framework for the applied use of networks to answer questions that are not only pressing within the field but also within broader biodiversity science.
