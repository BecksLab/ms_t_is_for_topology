  abstract = {This gap in knowledge regarding ecological interactions has prompted the development of various predictive approaches. Traditionally, ecological interactions have been inferred using traits. However, the lack of trait information for numerous organisms necessitates using phylogenetic data and statistical insights from interaction matrices for prediction. Previous studies have overlooked the validation of model-predicted interactions. This study used a novel method in predicting ecological interactions using a self-organizing map (SOM), an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. The SOM learns from the input interaction matrix by grouping the nodes into output layers based on their interactions. Subsequently, the trained model predicts the interactions as scores. To distinguish between interactions and non-interactions, we employed F1 score maximization, setting scores above a specific threshold as interactions and the remainder as non-interactions. We applied this method to three unipartite metawebs and one bipartite metaweb and subsequently validated the predicted interactions using two innovative approaches: taxonomic and interaction recovery validation. Our method exhibited outstanding predictive performance, particularly for large networks. Various binary classification performance indicators, including F1 score (0.84--0.97) and accuracy (0.97--0.99), indicated high performance. Moreover, the method generated minimal predicted interactions, signifying low noise in the predictions, particularly for large networks. Taxonomic validation excels in metawebs with a connectance {$>$}0.1 but performs poorly in metawebs with very low connectance. In contrast, interaction recovery was most effective in larger metawebs. Our proposed method excels at making highly accurate predictions of ecological interactions with minimal noise, solely utilizing input interaction data without relying on traits or phylogenetic information regarding interacting nodes. These predictions are particularly precise for large networks, underscoring their potential to address knowledge gaps in emerging extensive metawebs. Notably, taxonomic validation and interaction recovery methods are sensitive to connectance and network size, respectively, suggesting prospects for developing robust interaction validation methods.},

  abstract = {The productivity of marine ecosystems and the services they provide to humans are largely dependent on complex interactions between prey and predators. These are embedded in a diverse network of trophic interactions, resulting in a cascade of events following perturbations such as species extinction. The sheer scale of oceans, however, precludes the characterization of marine feeding networks through de novo sampling. This effort ought instead to rely on a combination of extensive data and inference. Here we investigate how the distribution of trophic interactions at the global scale shapes the marine fish food web structure. We hypothesize that the heterogeneous distribution of species ranges in biogeographic regions should concentrate interactions in the warmest areas and within species groups. We find that the inferred global metaweb of marine fish---that is, all possible potential feeding links between co-occurring species---is highly connected geographically with a low degree of spatial modularity. Metrics of network structure correlate with sea surface temperature and tend to peak towards the tropics. In contrast to open-water communities, coastal food webs have greater interaction redundancy, which may confer robustness to species extinction. Our results suggest that marine ecosystems are connected yet display some resistance to perturbations because of high robustness at most locations.},

It underlies classifications in evolution and ecology, including those used to describe phylogenetic levels, the habitat and functional roles of organisms in ecosystems. Surprisingly, this concept is not explicitly included in simple models for the structure of food webs, the ecological networks formed by consumer--resource interactions. We present here the simplest possible model based on groups, and show that it performs substantially better than current models at predicting the structure of large food webs. Our group-based model can be applied to different types of biological and non-biological networks, and for the first time merges in the same framework two important notions in network theory: that of compartments (sets of highly interacting nodes) and that of roles (sets of nodes that have similar interaction patterns). This model provides a basis to examine the significance of groups in biological networks and to develop more accurate models for ecological network structure. It is especially relevant at a time when a new generation of empirical data is providing increasingly large food webs.},

The number of modes of life actually utilized specifies realized ecospace. Owing to constraints of effectiveness and efficiency the modern marine fauna utilizes only about half the potential number of modes of life, two-thirds of which (62 of 92) are utilized by animals with readily preserved, mineralized hard parts. Realized ecospace has increased markedly since the early evolution of animal ecosystems. The Ediacaran fauna utilized at most 12 modes of life, with just two practised by skeletal organisms. A total of 30 modes of life are recorded in the Early and Middle Cambrian, 19 of which were utilized by skeletal organisms. The other 11 are documented from soft-bodied animals preserved in the Chengjiang and Burgess Shale Konservat-Lagerst{\"a}tten. The number of modes of life utilized by skeletal organisms increased by more than 50 per cent during the Ordovician radiation to a Late Ordovician total of 30. Between the Late Ordovician and the Recent the number of utilized modes of life has doubled again. The autecological and taxonomic diversity histories of the marine metazoa appear to be broadly parallel, and future studies of theoretical ecospace utilization should provide more detailed tests of pattern and process in the ecological history of the metazoa.},

  abstract = {Representing species interactions probabilistically (how likely are they to occur?) as opposed to deterministically (are they occurring?) conveys uncertainties in our knowledge of interactions and information on their variability. The sources of uncertainty captured by interaction probabilities depend on the method used to evaluate them: uncertainty of predictive models, subjective assessment of experts, or empirical measurement of interaction spatiotemporal variability. However, guidelines for the estimation and documentation of probabilistic interaction data are lacking. This is concerning because our understanding and analysis of interaction probabilities depend on their sometimes elusive definition and uncertainty sources. We review how probabilistic interactions are defined at different spatial scales, from local interactions to regional networks (metawebs), with a strong emphasis on host-parasite and trophic (predatory and herbivory) interactions. These definitions are based on the distinction between the realization of an interaction at a specific time and space (local) and its biological or ecological feasibility (regional). Using host-parasite interactions in Europe, we illustrate how these two network representations differ in their statistical properties, specifically: how local networks and metawebs differ in their spatial and temporal scaling of probabilistic interactions, but not in their taxonomic scaling. We present two approaches to inferring binary interactions from probabilistic ones that account for these differences and show that systematic biases arise when directly inferring local networks from metawebs. Our results underscore the importance of more rigorous descriptions of probabilistic species interaction networks that specify their type of interaction (local or regional), conditional variables and uncertainty sources.},

Ecological networks, in which two species are connected if they can interact, are a mathematical representation of all interactions encountered in a given ecosystem. Anchored in graph theory, the methods developed in network ecology are remarkably rigorous and biologically insightful. Indeed, many ecological and evolutionary processes are driven by species interactions and network structure (i.e. the arrangement of links in ecological networks). The study of ecological networks, from data importation and simulation to data analysis and visualization, requires a coherent and efficient set of numerical tools. With its powerful and dynamic type system, the Julia programming language provides a very good and fast computing environment suitable for ecological research. Julia's typing system notably ensures that appropriate methods are used when a function is applied to different types of ecological data, which therefore minimizes the risk of committing errors of analysis and interpretation in network ecology. Mangal.jl and EcologicalNetworks.jl are two novel and complementary Julia packages designed to conduct research in network ecology efficiently. Researchers studying a broad range of ecological networks can read the data and metadata of numerous well-documented networks using Mangal.jl, and analyze their properties using EcologicalNetworks.jl.},

  abstract = {Food webs are complex ecological networks whose structure is both ecologically and statistically constrained, with many network properties being correlated with each other. Despite the recognition of these invariable relationships in food webs, the use of the principle of maximum entropy (MaxEnt) in network ecology is still rare. This is surprising considering that MaxEnt is a statistical tool precisely designed for understanding and predicting many types of constrained systems. This principle asserts that the least-biased probability distribution of a system's property, constrained by prior knowledge about that system, is the one with maximum information entropy. MaxEnt has been proven useful in many ecological modeling problems, but its application in food webs and other ecological networks is limited. Here we show how MaxEnt can be used to derive many food-web properties both analytically and heuristically. First, we show how the joint degree distribution (the joint probability distribution of the numbers of prey and predators for each species in the network) can be derived analytically using the number of species and the number of interactions in food webs. Second, we present a heuristic and flexible approach of finding a network's adjacency matrix (the network's representation in matrix format) based on simulated annealing and SVD entropy. We built two heuristic models using the connectance and the joint degree sequence as statistical constraints, respectively. We compared both models' predictions against corresponding null and neutral models commonly used in network ecology using open access data of terrestrial and aquatic food webs sampled globally (N = 257). We found that the heuristic model constrained by the joint degree sequence was a good predictor of many measures of food-web structure, especially the nestedness and motifs distribution. Specifically, our results suggest that the structure of terrestrial and aquatic food webs is mainly driven by their joint degree distribution.},

  abstract = {Species interactions, ranging from antagonisms to mutualisms, form the architecture of biodiversity and determine ecosystem functioning. Understanding the rules responsible for who interacts with whom, as well as the functional consequences of these interspecific interactions, is central to predict community dynamics and stability. Species traits sensu lato may affect different ecological processes by determining species interactions through a two-step process. First, ecological and life-history traits govern species distributions and abundance, and hence determine species co-occurrence and the potential for species to interact. Secondly, morphological or physiological traits between co-occurring potential interaction partners should match for the realization of an interaction. Here, we review recent advances on predicting interactions from species co-occurrence and develop a probabilistic model for inferring trait matching. The models proposed here integrate both neutral and trait-matching constraints, while using only information about known interactions, thereby overcoming problems originating from undersampling of rare interactions (i.e. missing links). They can easily accommodate qualitative or quantitative data and can incorporate trait variation within species, such as values that vary along developmental stages or environmental gradients. We use three case studies to show that the proposed models can detect strong trait matching (e.g. predator--prey system), relaxed trait matching (e.g. herbivore--plant system) and barrier trait matching (e.g. plant--pollinator systems). Only by elucidating which species traits are important in each process (i.e. in determining interaction establishment and frequency), we can advance in explaining how species interact and the consequences of these interactions for ecosystem functioning.

Here we analyze 52 mutualistic networks and show that they are highly nested; that is, the more specialist species interact only with proper subsets of those species interacting with the more generalists. This assembly pattern generates highly asymmetrical interactions and organizes the community cohesively around a central core of interactions. Thus, mutualistic networks are neither randomly assembled nor organized in compartments arising from tight, parallel specialization. Furthermore, nestedness increases with the complexity (number of interactions) of the network: for a given number of species, communities with more interactions are significantly more nested. Our results indicate a nonrandom pattern of community organization that may be relevant for our understanding of the organization and persistence of biodiversity.},

  abstract = {Food webs, the networks of feeding links between species, are central to our understanding of ecosystem structure, stability, and function. One of the key aspects of food web structure is complexity, or connectance, the number of links expressed as a proportion of the total possible number of links. Connectance (complexity) is linked to the stability of webs and is a key parameter in recent models of other aspects of web structure. However, there is still no fundamental biological explanation for connectance in food webs. Here, we propose that constraints on diet breadth, driven by optimal foraging, provide such an explanation. We show that a simple diet breadth model predicts highly constrained values of connectance as an emergent consequence of individual foraging behavior. When combined with features of real food web data, such as taxonomic and trophic aggregation and cumulative sampling of diets, the model predicts well the levels of connectance and scaling of connectance with species richness, seen in real food webs. This result is a previously undescribed synthesis of foraging theory and food web theory, in which network properties emerge from the behavior of individuals and, as such, provides a mechanistic explanation of connectance currently lacking in food web models.},

  abstract = {Ecological interactions link species in networks. Loss of species from or introduction of new species into an existing network may have substantial effects for interaction patterns. Predicting changes in interaction frequency while allowing for rewiring of existing interactions---and hence estimating the consequences of community compositional changes---is thus a central challenge for network ecology. Interactions between species groups, such as pollinators and flowers or parasitoids and hosts, are moderated by matching morphological traits or sensory clues, most of which are unknown to us. If these traits are phylogenetically conserved, however, we can use phylogenetic distances to construct latent, surrogate traits and try to match those across groups, in addition to observed traits. Understanding how important traits and trait matching are, relative to abundances and chance, is crucial to estimating the fundamental predictability of network interactions. Here, we present a statistically sound approach (``tapnet'') to fitting abundances, traits, and phylogeny to observed network data to predict interaction frequencies. We thereby expand existing approaches to quantitative bipartite networks, which so far have failed to correctly represent the nonindependence of network interactions. Furthermore, we use simulations and cross validation on independent data to evaluate the predictive power of the fit. Our results show that tapnet is on a par with abundance-only, matching centrality, and machine learning approaches. This approach also allows us to evaluate how well current concepts of trait matching work. On the basis of our results, we expect that interactions in well-sampled networks can be well predicted if traits and abundances are the main driver of interaction frequency.}

By applying a network-based dynamical approach to synthetic and real-world mutualistic ecosystems, we show that biodiversity recovery following collapse is maximized when extirpated species are reintroduced based solely on their total number of connections in the original interaction network. More complex network-based strategies that prioritize the reintroduction of species that improve `higher order' topological features such as compartmentalization do not provide meaningful performance improvements. These results suggest that it is possible to design nearly optimal restoration strategies that maximize biodiversity recovery for data-poor ecosystems in order to ensure the delivery of critical natural services that fuel economic development, food security, and human health around the globe.},

  abstract = {Predicting species interactions within ecological networks is vital for understanding ecosystem functioning and the response of communities to changing environments. Traditional link prediction models often fall short due to sparse and incomplete data and are limited to single networks. Here, we present a novel approach using inductive link prediction (ILP), which leverages structural similarities across diverse ecological networks. Our model pools data across communities, and uses transfer learning to enable prediction within and between different ecological communities. We applied our model to 538 networks across four community types: plant-seed disperser, plant-pollinator, host-parasite, and plant-herbivore. ILP outperforms non-ILP models, particularly in host-parasite and plant-seed disperser networks. However, the efficacy of cross-community predictions varies, with plant-pollinator networks consistently under-performing as train and test sets. Moreover, we developed the first method to computationally estimate the limits of link prediction given a certain proportion of missing links, in which ILP performs better than a non-ILP model. This study underscores the potential of ILP to generalize link prediction across different ecological contexts.},

This proposition first envisioned by Forbes (1907) and then Diamond (1975) prompted the development of numerous modelling approaches (e.g. null model analysis, co-occurrence networks and, more recently, joint species distribution models). Both theory and experimental evidence support the idea that ecological interactions may affect co-occurrence, but it remains unclear to what extent the signal of interaction can be captured in observational data. It is now time to step back from the statistical developments and critically assess whether co-occurrence data are really a proxy for ecological interactions. In this paper, we present a series of arguments based on probability, sampling, food web and coexistence theories supporting that significant spatial associations between species (or lack thereof) is a poor proxy for ecological interactions. We discuss appropriate interpretations of co-occurrence, along with potential avenues to extract as much information as possible from such data.},

As a result, studies potentially draw flawed conclusions about ecological function, stability, or coextinction risks. We highlight potential biases in analyzing and interpreting species-interaction networks and review the solutions available to overcome them, among which we particularly recommend the use of null models that account for species abundances. We show why considering variation across species and networks is important for understanding species interactions and their consequences.

  abstract = {Network analyses of mutualistic or antagonistic interactions between species are very popular, but their biological interpretations are often unclear and incautious. Here I propose to distinguish two possible implications of network patterns in conjunction with solutions to avoid misinterpretations. Interpretations can be either(1)niche-based, describing specialisation, trait (mis-)matching between species, niche breadth and niche overlap and their relationship to interspecific competition and species coexistence, or(2)impact-based, focusing on frequencies of interactions between species such as predation or infection rates and mutualistic services, aiming to quantify each species' relative contribution to an ecological effect. For niche-based implications, it is crucial to acknowledge the sampling limitations of a network and thus control for the number of observations of each species. This is particularly important for those kinds of networks that summarise observed interactions in communities (e.g. bipartite host--parasitoid or plant--animal networks), rather than compile information from different sources or experiments (as in many food webs). Variation in total observation frequencies may alone explain network patterns that have often been interpreted as `specialisation asymmetries' (nestedness, dependence asymmetries). I show analytically that `dependence asymmetries' between two species (or two guilds) only reflect variation in their total observation frequencies. To depict true asymmetries in niche breadth, independent data are required for both species. Moreover, simulated co-extinction scenarios assume that each species `depends' on its associated partners in the network (again niche-based), but species that appear most endangered are simply those with one or very few observations and are not necessarily specialised. Distinguishing niche-based and impact-based interpretations may help to bridge terminological and conceptual gaps between network pattern analyses and traditional community ecology. Zusammenfassung Mutualistische oder antagonistische Beziehungen zwischen Arten einer Gemeinschaft werden derzeit h{\"a}ufig mit Hilfe von Netzwerkanalysen beschrieben. Da die biologische Deutung solcher Analysen oft missverst{\"a}ndlich ist, wird in diesem Artikel vorgeschlagen, zwei Interpretationsarten zu unterscheiden:(1){\"O}kologische Nische, z.B. Spezialisierung, Nischenbreite und {\"u}berlappung, sowie Kompatibilit{\"a}t von Merkmalen zwischen Arten.(2)Interaktionseffekte, die von der relativen H{\"a}ufigkeit der Wechselwirkungen abh{\"a}ngig sind, z.B. Pr{\"a}dations- und Infektionsraten oder mutualistische Funktionen. Bei nischenbezogenen Deutungen von Netzwerken, die auf beobachteten Interaktionen basieren, muss jedoch ber{\"u}cksichtigt werden, dass die Gesamtzahl der Beobachtungen pro Art limitiert ist und sich zwischen Arten stark unterscheidet. Allein diese Variation kann viele Netzwerkmuster erkl{\"a}ren, beispielsweise ``Nestedness'', was oft als asymmetrische Spezialisierung missverstanden wurde. Hier wird analytisch bewiesen, dass eine mutma{\ss}liche ``Spezialisierungs-Asymmetrie'' zwischen zwei Arten allein auf deren unterschiedliche Beobachtungsh{\"a}ufigkeit zur{\"u}ckgef{\"u}hrt werden kann. Unhabh{\"a}ngig erhobene Daten f{\"u}r beide Arten sind notwendig, um diesen Trugschluss zu vermeiden. Das Aussterben von Arten durch Verlust des Assoziationspartners (Koextinktion) wurde in mehreren publizierten Studien modelliert. Solche Simulationen basieren auf der Annahme, dass jede Art von seinen beobachteten Assoziationspartnern abh{\"a}ngig ist (nischenbasierte Deutung). Hier kann jedoch gezeigt werden, dass vor allem solche Arten scheinbar gef{\"a}hrdet sind, die nur ein- oder wenige Male beobachtet wurden, also nicht notwendigerweise Spezialisten darstellen. Die explizite Unterscheidung zwischen nischen- und effektbasierter Interpretation k{\"o}nnte demnach eine hilfreiche konzeptionelle Br{\"u}cke darstellen, um Netzwerkanalysen und klassische Gemeinschafts{\"o}kologie zusammenzuf{\"u}hren.},

  abstract = {Inferring the functional shape of ecological and evolutionary processes from time-series data can be challenging because processes are often not describable with simple equations. The dynamical coupling between variables in time series further complicates the identification of equations through model selection as the inference of a given process is contingent on the accurate depiction of all other processes. We present a novel method, neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), for learning ecological and evolutionary processes from time-series data by modelling dynamical systems as ordinary differential equations and dynamical functions with artificial neural networks (ANNs). Upon successful training, the ANNs converge to functional shapes that best describe the biological processes underlying the dynamics observed, in a way that is robust to mathematical misspecifications of the dynamical model. We demonstrate NODEs in a population dynamic context and show how they can be used to infer ecological interactions, dynamical causation and equilibrium points. We tested NODEs by analysing well-understood hare and lynx time-series data, which revealed that prey--predator oscillations were mainly driven by the interspecific interaction, as well as intraspecific densitydependence, and characterised by a single equilibrium point at the centre of the oscillation. Our approach is applicable to any system that can be modelled with differential equations, and particularly suitable for linking ecological, evolutionary and environmental dynamics where parametric approaches are too challenging to implement, opening new avenues for theoretical and empirical investigations.},

  abstract = {Ecological Network Analysis (ENA) has provided insights into the structure, function, and transformation of ecosystems for more than forty years. Key insights from ENA focus on how the patterns of directed weighted transactions among system components (e.g., species, functional groups, economic sectors) create emergent and often unexpected relationships in ecosystems that affect system function and sustainability. Flow analysis, also called throughflow analysis, is one of several core techniques in ENA. Generally, it traces the flux of energy or matter through the network from inputs to outputs. During the forty-years of development, flow analysis has accreted multiple extensions and modifications. In this concept and synthesis paper, we review four flow analyses and show how they are conceptually linked by partitioning flows across subsets of pathways within networks. These flow analyses include: (1) the definition of throughflow, a measure of the total processing power of a network; (2) Leontief's decomposition based on walk length, indicating the direction and distance of energy or matter flow; (3) Finn's measure of recycling of matter in networks; and (4) five mode analysis, characterizing flows according to their origin and destination. Presenting these techniques side-by-side with a common conceptual framework reveals overlaps and distinctive elements among the analytic products. This synthesis clarifies the flow analyses tools and their applications to ecological and socio-economic networks and provides example applications. Further, new insights are presented by combining existing flow analyses to calculate novel indices that further characterize the flow structure of networks. For example, both indirect flows in networks and cycling are highly important features in networks. In order to determine the proportion of indirect flows generated through cycling, we can use the ratio of Cycled Flow identified from Finn's analysis and the indirect flows identified in the Leontief analysis. As ENA matures through additional analysis development and applications, it will continue to provide insights into ecosystems and contribute to the broader area of network science.},

  abstract = {Process-based community models are required to extrapolate beyond current dynamics and anticipate biodiversity response to global change, but their adoption has been limited in practice because of issues with model parameter estimation and model inaccuracies. While observation data could be used to directly estimate parameters and refine model structures, model nonlinearities, sparse and noisy datasets and the complexity of ecological dynamics complicate this process. Here, we propose an inverse modelling framework designed for addressing these issues, that relies on a segmentation method combined with automatic differentiation, deep learning gradient-based optimizers, minibatching, and a parameter normalization technique. By partitioning the data into time series with a short time horizon, we show that the segmentation method regularizes the inverse problem. Implemented in the Julia package PiecewiseInference.jl, the resulting framework enables the efficient calibration of realistic dynamical community models and supports the use of neural networks to represent complex ecological processes within the model. We evaluate the performance of the inverse modelling framework on simulated food-web dynamics of increasing complexity, including scenarios with partial observations. Our results demonstrate its performance in inferring model parameters and providing forecasts. We further showcase that the regularization induced by the framework, together with its efficiency, are instrumental for the online training of neural network-based parametrizations, alongside the other model parameters. Neural network-based parametrizations not only mitigate model inaccuracies but can also contribute to the refinement of ecological theory through their offline examination. The proposed inverse modelling framework is data-efficient, interpretable and capable of extrapolating beyond observed dynamics, showing promise in improving our ability to understand and forecast biodiversity dynamics.},

Identifying whether seasonal network changes are the result of turnover or rewiring (i.e. rearrangement of interactions among species), also remains understudied in multi-trophic communities. Using species abundance data for 38 species over three years (from nine sites across central/eastern United States) and a novel tree-based inference method, we constructed seasonal networks for a multi-trophic freshwater stream fish community. We found that seasonality influences species interactions, particularly through rewiring (81\%) as compared to species turnover (19\%). Moreover, the number of rewiring interactions was best explained by fish status as a piscivore/non-piscivore and species maximum length (R2 = 0.41). Our findings suggest that rewiring may be a dominant process in stream fish communities experiencing seasonal environments and that traits linked to trophic-level could be a good indicator of a species contribution to rewiring. As networks dominated by rewiring may be more robust, this network approach could be a valuable conservation tool for identifying which biological relationships must be retained for communities to avoid extinction.},

Yet, topological properties identified across these networks may not be sufficiently attributable to ecological processes alone as often assumed. Instead, much of the totality of topological differences between networks---topological heterogeneity---could be due to variations in research designs and approaches that different researchers use to create each species interaction network. To evaluate the degree to which this topological heterogeneity is present in available ecological networks, we first compared the amount of topological heterogeneity across 723 species interaction networks created by different sets of researchers with the amount quantified from non-ecological networks known to be constructed following more consistent approaches. Then, to further test whether the topological heterogeneity was due to differences in study designs, and not only to inherent variation within ecological networks, we compared the amount of topological heterogeneity between species interaction networks created by the same sets of researchers (i.e., networks from the same publication) with the amount quantified between networks that were each from a unique publication source. We found that species interaction networks are highly topologically heterogeneous: while species interaction networks from the same publication are much more topologically similar to each other than interaction networks that are from a unique publication, they still show at least twice as much heterogeneity as any category of non-ecological networks that we tested. Altogether, our findings suggest that extra care is necessary to effectively analyze species interaction networks created by different researchers, perhaps by controlling for the publication source of each network.},

Metabolic rate, the rate at which organisms take up, transform, and expend energy and materials, is the most fundamental biological rate. We have developed a quantitative theory for how metabolic rate varies with body size and temperature. Metabolic theory predicts how metabolic rate, by setting the rates of resource uptake from the environment and resource allocation to survival, growth, and reproduction, controls ecological processes at all levels of organization from individuals to the biosphere. Examples include: (1) life history attributes, including development rate, mortality rate, age at maturity, life span, and population growth rate; (2) population interactions, including carrying capacity, rates of competition and predation, and patterns of species diversity; and (3) ecosystem processes, including rates of biomass production and respiration and patterns of trophic dynamics. Data compiled from the ecological literature strongly support the theoretical predictions. Eventually, metabolic theory may provide a conceptual foundation for much of ecology, just as genetic theory provides a foundation for much of evolutionary biology.},

  abstract = {Ecologists increasingly recognize that interactions between two species can be affected by the density of a third species. How these higher-order interactions (HOIs) affect species persistence remains poorly understood. To explore the effect of HOIs stemming from multiple trophic layers on a plant community composition, we experimentally built a mesocosm with three plants and three pollinator species arranged in a fully nested and modified network structure. We estimated pairwise interactions among plants and between plants and pollinators, as well as HOIs initiated by a plant or a pollinator affecting plant species pairs. Using a structuralist approach, we evaluated the consequences of the statistically supported HOIs on the persistence probability of each of the three competing plant species and their combinations. HOIs substantially redistribute the strength and sign of pairwise interactions between plant species, promoting the opportunities for multispecies communities to persist compared with a non-HOI scenario. However, the physical elimination of a plant-pollinator link in the modified network structure promotes changes in per capita pairwise interactions and HOIs, resulting in a single-species community. Our study provides empirical evidence of the joint importance of HOIs and network structure in determining species persistence within diverse communities.},

Historically, much effort has focused on niche-mediated processes to explain these structures, while an emerging consensus posits that both niche and neutral mechanisms simultaneously shape many features of ecological communities. However, the study of interaction networks still lacks a comprehensive neutral theory. Here we present a neutral model of predator-prey interactions and analyze the structural characteristics of the simulated networks. We find that connectance values (complexity) and complexity-diversity relationships of neutral networks are close to those observed in empirical bipartite networks. High nestedness and low modularity values observed in neutral networks fall in the range of those from empirical antagonist bipartite networks. Our results suggest that, as an alternative to niche-mediated processes that induce incompatibility between species (``niche forbidden links''), neutral processes create ``neutral forbidden links'' due to uneven species abundance distributions and the low probability of interaction between rare species. Neutral trophic networks must be seen as the missing endpoint of a continuum from niche to purely stochastic approaches of community organization.},

A promising approach to fill this gap is to predict interactions based on functional traits, but many questions remain about how well we can predict interactions for different taxa, ecosystems and amounts of input data. Here, we built a new traits-based model of trophic interactions for European vertebrates and found that even models calibrated with 0.1\% of the interactions (100 out of 71 k) estimated the full European vertebrate food web reasonably well. However, predators were easier to predict than prey, especially for some clades (e.g. fowl and storks) and local food web connectance was consistently overestimated.

  abstract = {Aim Food webs are essential for understanding how ecosystems function, but empirical data on the interactions that make up these ecological networks are lacking for most taxa in most ecosystems. Trait-based models can fill these data gaps, but their ability to do so has not been widely tested. We test how well these models can extrapolate to new ecological communities both in terms of pairwise predator--prey interactions and higher level food web attributes (i.e. species position, food web-level properties). Location Canada, Europe, Tanzania. Time Period Current. Major Taxa Studied Terrestrial vertebrates. Methods We train trait-based models of pairwise trophic interactions on four independent vertebrate food webs (Canadian tundra, Serengeti, alpine south-eastern Pyrenees and Europe) and evaluate how well these models predict pairwise interactions and network properties of each food web. Results We find that, overall, trait-based models predict most interactions and their absence correctly. Performance was best for training and testing on the same food web (AUC {$>$} 0.90) and declined with environmental and phylogenetic distances with the strongest loss of performance for the tundra-Serengeti ecosystems (AUC {$>$} 0.75). Network metrics were less well-predicted than single interactions by our models with predicted food webs being more connected, less modular, and with higher mean trophic levels than observed. Main Conclusions Theory predicts that the variability observed in food webs can be explained by differences in trait distributions and trait-matching relationships. Our finding that trait-based models can predict many trophic interactions, even in contrasting environments, adds to the growing body of evidence that there are general constraints on interactions and that trait-based methods can serve as a useful first approximation of food webs in unknown areas. However, food webs are more than the sum of their parts, and predicting network attributes will likely require models that simultaneously predict individual interactions and community constraints.},

  abstract = {Ecosystems are composed of networks of interacting species. These interactions allow communities of species to persist through time through both neutral and adaptive processes. Despite their importance, a robust understanding of (and ability to predict and forecast) interactions among species remains elusive. This knowledge-gap is largely driven by a shortfall of data---although species occurrence data has rapidly increased in the last decade, species interaction data has not kept pace, largely due to the effort required to sample interactions. This means there are many interactions between species that occur in nature, but we do not know these interactions occur because we have never observed them. These so-called ``false-negatives'' bias data and hinder inference about the structure and dynamics of interaction networks. Here, we demonstrate the realized rate of false-negatives in data can be quite high, even in thoroughly sampled systems, due to the intrinsic variation in abundances across species in a community. We illustrate how a null model of occurrence detection can be used to estimate the false-negative rate in a given dataset. We also show how to directly incorporate uncertainty due to observation error into model-based predictions of interaction probabilities between species. One hypothesis is that interactions between ``rare'' species are themselves rare because these species are less likely to encounter one-another than species of higher relative abundance, and that this can (in part) explain the common pattern of nestedness in bipartite interaction networks. However, we demonstrate that across several datasets of spatial or temporally replicated networks, there are positive associations between species co-occurrence and interactions, which suggests these interactions among ``rare'' species actually exist but simply are not observed. Finally, we assess how false negatives influence various models of network prediction, and recommend directly accounting for observation error in predictive models. We conclude by discussing how the understanding of false-negatives can inform how we design monitoring schemes for species interactions.},

Unfortunately, they fail to describe adequately recent and high-quality data. Here, we propose a new model built on the hypothesis that any species' diet is the consequence of phylogenetic constraints and adaptation. Simple rules incorporating both concepts yield food webs whose structure is very close to real data. Consumers are organized in groups forming a nested hierarchy, which better reflects the complexity and multidimensionality of most natural systems.},

  abstract = {How does the long--term behaviour near equilibrium of model food webs correlate with their short--term transient dynamics? Here, simulations of the Lotka--Volterra cascade model of food webs provide the first evidence to answer this question. Transient behaviour is measured by resilience, reactivity, the maximum amplification of a perturbation and the time at which the maximum amplification occurs. Model food webs with a higher probability of local asymptotic stability may be less resilient and may have a larger transient growth of perturbations. Given a fixed connectance, the sizes and durations of transient responses to perturbations increase with the number of species. Given a fixed number of species, as connectance increases, the sizes and durations of transient responses to perturbations may increase or decrease depending on the type of link that is varied. Reactivity is more sensitive to changes in the number of donor--controlled links than to changes in the number of recipient--controlled links, while resilience is more sensitive to changes in the number of recipient--controlled links than to changes in the number of donor--controlled links. Transient behaviour is likely to be one of the important factors affecting the persistence of ecological communities.},

Current approaches to mapping food webs are mostly based on traits, expert knowledge, experiments, and/or statistical inference. However, they do not offer clear mechanisms explaining how trophic interactions are affected by the interplay between organism characteristics and aspects of the physical environment, such as temperature, light intensity or viscosity. Hence, they cannot yet predict accurately how local food webs will respond to anthropogenic pressures, notably to climate change and species invasions. Herein, we propose a framework that synthesises recent developments in food-web theory, integrating body size and metabolism with the physical properties of ecosystems. We advocate for combination of the movement paradigm with a modular definition of the predation sequence, because movement is central to predator--prey interactions, and a generic, modular model is needed to describe all the possible variation in predator--prey interactions. Pending sufficient empirical and theoretical knowledge, our framework will help predict the food-web impacts of well-studied physical factors, such as temperature and oxygen availability, as well as less commonly considered variables such as wind, turbidity or electrical conductivity. An improved predictive capability will facilitate a better understanding of ecosystem responses to a changing world.},

  abstract = {1.Descriptions of ecological networks typically assume that the same interspecific interactions occur each time a community is observed. This contrasts with the known stochasticity of ecological communities: community composition, species abundances, and link structure all vary in space and time. Moreover, finite sampling generates variation in the set of interactions actually observed. For interactions that have not been observed, most data sets will not contain enough information for the ecologist to be con\_dent that unobserved interactions truly did not occur. 2. Here we develop the conceptual and analytical tools needed to capture uncertainty in the estimation of pairwise interactions. To define the problem, we identify the different contributions to the uncertainty of an interaction. We then outline a framework to quantify the uncertainty around each interaction by combining data on observed co-occurrences with prior knowledge. We illustrate this framework using perhaps the most extensively sampled network to date. 3. We found significant uncertainty in estimates for the probability of most pairwise interactions. This uncertainty can, however, be constrained with informative priors. This uncertainty scaled up to summary measures of network structure such as connectance and nestedness. Even with informative priors, we are likely to miss many interactions that may occur rarely or under different local conditions. 4. Overall, we demonstrate the importance of acknowledging the uncertainty inherent in network studies, and the utility of treating interactions as probabilities in pinpointing areas where more study is needed. Most importantly, we stress that networks are best thought of as systems constructed from random variables, the stochastic nature of which must be acknowledged for an accurate representation. Doing so will fundamentally change networks analyses and yield greater realism. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

Here, we characterize the structural consequences of life stage variation in five food webs, including a newly compiled web from the Arabian Gulf. We show that making life stage variation explicit in food webs results in larger food webs that possess consistent structural changes that are separate from the changes in structure that come simply from increasing the number of nodes in the webs. Furthermore, we show that the magnitude of these changes is related to ontogenetic specialism, the degree of overlap in the ecological niches of life stages. These results demonstrate the capacity of intraspecific variation to affect ecological networks and indicate the potential usefulness of stage-structured food webs, which capture size and taxonomic information, to represent variation below the species level.},

  abstract = {Most ecosystem functions and related services involve species interactions across trophic levels, for example, pollination and biological pest control. Despite this, our understanding of ecosystem function in multitrophic communities is poor, and research has been limited to either manipulation in small communities or statistical descriptions in larger ones. Recent advances in food web ecology may allow us to overcome the trade-off between mechanistic insight and ecological realism. Molecular tools now simplify the detection of feeding interactions, and trait-based approaches allow the application of dynamic food web models to real ecosystems. We performed the first test of an allometric food web model's ability to replicate temporally nonaggregated abundance data from the field and to provide mechanistic insight into the function of predation. We aimed to reproduce and explore the drivers of the population dynamics of the aphid herbivore Rhopalosiphum padi observed in ten Swedish barley fields. We used a dynamic food web model, taking observed interactions and abundances of predators and alternative prey as input data, allowing us to examine the role of predation in aphid population control. The inverse problem methods were used for simultaneous model fit optimization and model parameterization. The model captured {$>$}70\% of the variation in aphid abundance in five of ten fields, supporting the model-embodied hypothesis that body size can be an important determinant of predation in the arthropod community. We further demonstrate how in-depth model analysis can disentangle the likely drivers of function, such as the community's abundance and trait composition. Analysing the variability in model performance revealed knowledge gaps, such as the source of episodic aphid mortality, and general method development needs that, if addressed, would further increase model success and enable stronger inference about ecosystem function. The results demonstrate that confronting dynamic food web models with abundance data from the field is a viable approach to evaluate ecological theory and to aid our understanding of function in real ecosystems. However, to realize the full potential of food web models, in ecosystem function research and beyond, trait-based parameterization must be refined and extended to include more traits than body size.},

The nodes may have qualitative and quantitative characteristics, and the edges may have properties such as weights and directions. Graph theory provides a flexible conceptual model that can clarify the relationship between structures and processes, including the mechanisms of configuration effects and compositional differences. Graph concepts apply to many ecological and evolutionary phenomena, including interspecific associations, spatial structure, dispersal in landscapes, and relationships within metapopulations and metacommunities. We review applications of graph theory in biology, emphasizing graphs with spatial contexts. We show how spatial graph properties can be used for description and comparison as well as to test specific hypotheses. We suggest that future applications should include explicit spatial elements for landscape studies of ecological, genetic and epidemiological phenomena.}

Harnessing this variability, we will show that it is useful to interpret empirically observed food webs as realisations of a family of stochastic processes, namely random dot-product graph models. These models provide an ideal extension of food-web models beyond the limitations of current deterministic or partially probabilistic models. As an additional benefit, our RDPG framework enables us to identify the pairwise distance structure given by species' functional food-web traits: this allows for the natural emergence of ecologically meaningful species groups. Lastly, our results suggest the notion that the evolutionary signature in food webs is already detectable in their stochastic backbones, while the contribution of their fine wiring is arguable. Synthesis Food webs are influenced by many stochastic processes and are constantly evolving. Here, we treat observed food webs as realisations of random dot-product graph models (RDPG), extending food-web modelling beyond the limitations of current deterministic or partially probabilistic models. Our RDPG framework enables us to identify the pairwise-distance structure given by species' functional food-web traits, which in turn allows for the natural emergence of ecologically meaningful species groups. It also provides a way to measure the phylogenetic signal present in food webs, which we find is strongest in webs' low-dimensional backbones.},

  abstract = {Networks are a way to represent interactions among one (e.g., social networks) or more (e.g., plant-pollinator networks) classes of nodes. The ability to predict likely, but unobserved, interactions has generated a great deal of interest, and is sometimes referred to as the link prediction problem. However, most studies of link prediction have focused on social networks, and have assumed a completely censused network. In biological networks, it is unlikely that all interactions are censused, and ignoring incomplete detection of interactions may lead to biased or incorrect conclusions. Previous attempts to predict network interactions have relied on known properties of network structure, making the approach sensitive to observation errors. This is an obvious shortcoming, as networks are dynamic, and sometimes not well sampled, leading to incomplete detection of links. Here, we develop an algorithm to predict missing links based on conditional probability estimation and associated, node-level features. We validate this algorithm on simulated data, and then apply it to a desert small mammal host-parasite network. Our approach achieves high accuracy on simulated and observed data, providing a simple method to accurately predict missing links in networks without relying on prior knowledge about network structure.},

Yet, recent developments of metawebs highlight efficient ways to first document possible interactions within regional species pools. Downscaling metawebs towards local network predictions is a promising approach to use current data to investigate the variation of networks across space. However, issues remain in how to represent the spatial variability and uncertainty of species interactions, especially for large scale food webs. Here, we present a probabilistic framework to downscale a metaweb based on the Canadian mammal metaweb and species occurrences from GBIF. We investigate how our approach can be used to represent the variability of networks and communities between ecoregions in Canada. Our results highlighted mismatches in the distribution of species richness and interactions, especially in their within-ecoregion variability, indicating that interactions vary differently than species distributions over continental-scale gradients. Results summarized by ecoregion showed non-constant variation within and between ecologically meaningful biogeographic boundaries and identified contrasting diversity hotspots. Our method offers the potential to bring global predictions down to a more actionable local scale, and increases the diversity of ecological networks that can be projected in space.},

  abstract = {Network approaches to ecological questions have been increasingly used, particularly in recent decades. The abstraction of ecological systems -- such as communities -- through networks of interactions between their components indeed provides a way to summarize this information with single objects. The methodological framework derived from graph theory also provides numerous approaches and measures to analyze these objects and can offer new perspectives on established ecological theories as well as tools to address new challenges. However, prior to using these methods to test ecological hypotheses, it is necessary that we understand, adapt, and use them in ways that both allow us to deliver their full potential and account for their limitations. Here, we attempt to increase the accessibility of network approaches by providing a review of the tools that have been developed so far, with -- what we believe to be -- their appropriate uses and potential limitations. This is not an exhaustive review of all methods and metrics, but rather, an overview of tools that are robust, informative, and ecologically sound. After providing a brief presentation of species interaction networks and how to build them in order to summarize ecological information of different types, we then classify methods and metrics by the types of ecological questions that they can be used to answer from global to local scales, including methods for hypothesis testing and future perspectives. Specifically, we show how the organization of species interactions in a community yields different network structures (e.g., more or less dense, modular or nested), how different measures can be used to describe and quantify these emerging structures, and how to compare communities based on these differences in structures. Within networks, we illustrate metrics that can be used to describe and compare the functional and dynamic roles of species based on their position in the network and the organization of their interactions as well as associated new methods to test the significance of these results. Lastly, we describe potential fruitful avenues for new methodological developments to address novel ecological questions.},

Different techniques have been devised to predict species interactions using theoretical models or abundances. Here, we explore the K nearest neighbour approach, with a special emphasis on recommendation, along with a supervised machine learning technique. Recommenders are algorithms developed for companies like Netflix to predict whether a customer will like a product given the preferences of similar customers. These machine learning techniques are well-suited to study binary ecological interactions since they focus on positive-only data. By removing a prey from a predator, we find that recommenders can guess the missing prey around 50\% of the times on the first try, with up to 881 possibilities. Traits do not improve significantly the results for the K nearest neighbour, although a simple test with a supervised learning approach (random forests) show we can predict interactions with high accuracy using only three traits per species. This result shows that binary interactions can be predicted without regard to the ecological community given only three variables: body mass and two variables for the species' phylogeny. These techniques are complementary, as recommenders can predict interactions in the absence of traits, using only information about other species' interactions, while supervised learning algorithms such as random forests base their predictions on traits only but do not exploit other species' interactions. Further work should focus on developing custom similarity measures specialized for ecology to improve the KNN algorithms and using richer data to capture indirect relationships between species.},

This invites the question whether network ecology is on a good path to providing di{\dbend}erent viewpoints and new insights.

On the one hand, the word ``network'' has become an empty buzzword void of speci{\dbend}c meaning. On the other, there are six problems that I deem to be ``deal breakers'' in research on interaction networks: unless they all are resolved, this approach cannot make meaningful contributions. They are: ({\dbend}) sampling bias; ({\dbend}) ecological meaning of recorded interactions; ({\dbend}) data aggregation over individuals; ({\dbend}) lack of quantitative expectation; and ({\dbend}) ecologically meaningless indices. Together they lead to the biggest problem ({\dbend}) confusion in what it all means ecologically. Until these issues are being tackled by improved {\dbend}eld and computational research, there seem to be little progress possible in our understanding of assemblages of interacting species under the header of ``network ecology''.},

  abstract = {Understanding how species extinctions affect communities of interacting species is an important challenge of ecology. The presence of unfeasible interactions, termed forbidden links, due to physiological or morphological barriers, is likely to decrease the plasticity of interaction networks, affecting their robustness to species extinctions. However, the existence of these forbidden links has been long debated, stressing the need to learn more about their prevalence and putative consequences for community robustness to extinctions. To tackle this gap, we used a dataset of plant-hummingbird interactions collected in Brazil, Costa Rica and Ecuador along elevation gradients. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model, to assess the probabilistic importance of exploitation barriers in determining species interactions. We found evidence for exploitation barriers between flowers and hummingbirds with a shorter bill than the corolla. We also showed that the proportion of forbidden links can change drastically among communities, because of changes in trait distributions. Finally we showed that networks with a high proportion of forbidden links had low robustness, because of constraints on interaction rewiring. Our results suggest that exploitation barriers are not rare and strongly limit interaction rewiring, and thus the rescue of species experiencing partner extinction may be limited.},

Most research on mass extinctions ignores species interactions and community structure, limiting inference about which and why species go extinct, and how Red Queen processes that link speciation to extinction rates affect the subsequent recovery of biodiversity, structure and function. Here, we apply network reconstruction, secondary extinction modelling and community structure analysis to the Early Toarcian (Lower Jurassic; 183\,Ma) Extinction Event and recovery. We find that primary extinctions targeted towards infaunal guilds, which caused secondary extinction cascades to higher trophic levels, reproduce the empirical post-extinction community most accurately. We find that the extinction event caused a switch from a diverse community with high levels of functional redundancy to a less diverse, more densely connected community of generalists. Recovery was characterised by a return to pre-extinction levels of some elements of community structure and function prior to the recovery of biodiversity. Full ecosystem recovery took {\textasciitilde}7 million years at which point we see evidence of dramatically increased vertical structure linked to the Mesozoic Marine Revolution and modern marine ecosystem structure.},

  abstract = {A rich body of empirically grounded theory has developed about food webs---the networks of feeding relationships among species within habitats. However, detailed food-web data and analyses are lacking for ancient ecosystems, largely because of the low resolution of taxa coupled with uncertain and incomplete information about feeding interactions. These impediments appear insurmountable for most fossil assemblages; however, a few assemblages with excellent soft-body preservation across trophic levels are candidates for food-web data compilation and topological analysis. Here we present plausible, detailed food webs for the Chengjiang and Burgess Shale assemblages from the Cambrian Period. Analyses of degree distributions and other structural network properties, including sensitivity analyses of the effects of uncertainty associated with Cambrian diet designations, suggest that these early Paleozoic communities share remarkably similar topology with modern food webs. Observed regularities reflect a systematic dependence of structure on the numbers of taxa and links in a web. Most aspects of Cambrian food-web structure are well-characterized by a simple ``niche model,'' which was developed for modern food webs and takes into account this scale dependence. However, a few aspects of topology differ between the ancient and recent webs: longer path lengths between species and more species in feeding loops in the earlier Chengjiang web, and higher variability in the number of links per species for both Cambrian webs. Our results are relatively insensitive to the exclusion of low-certainty or random links. The many similarities between Cambrian and recent food webs point toward surprisingly strong and enduring constraints on the organization of complex feeding interactions among metazoan species. The few differences could reflect a transition to more strongly integrated and constrained trophic organization within ecosystems following the rapid diversification of species, body plans, and trophic roles during the Cambrian radiation. More research is needed to explore the generality of food-web structure through deep time and across habitats, especially to investigate potential mechanisms that could give rise to similar structure, as well as any differences.},

We examined this issue by analyzing the network structure of food webs for the Northeast US Shelf, a Caribbean reef, and Benguela, off South Africa. The values of connectance (links per species2), link density (links per species), mean chain length, and fractions of intermediate, omnivorous, and cannibalistic taxa of these marine webs are somewhat high but still within the ranges observed in other webs. We further compared the marine webs by using the empirically corroborated `niche model' that accounts for observed variation in diversity (taxon number) and complexity (connectance). Our results substantiate previously reported results for estuarine, fresh-water, and terrestrial datasets, which suggests that food webs from different types of ecosystems with variable diversity and complexity share fundamental structural and ordering characteristics. Analyses of potential secondary extinctions resulting from species loss show that the structural robustness of marine food webs is also consistent with trends from other food webs. As expected, given their relatively high connectance, marine food webs appear fairly robust to loss of most-connected taxa as well as random taxa.

The loss of a species is expected to result in the loss of other species that depend on it (coextinction), leading to cascading effects across trophic levels. Such effects are likely to be most severe in mutualistic and parasitic interactions. Indeed, models suggest that coextinction may be the most common form of biodiversity loss. Paradoxically, few historical or contemporary coextinction events have actually been recorded. We review the current knowledge of coextinction by: (i) considering plausible explanations for the discrepancy between predicted and observed coextinction rates; (ii) exploring the potential consequences of coextinctions; (iii) discussing the interactions and synergies between coextinction and other drivers of species loss, particularly climate change; and (iv) suggesting the way forward for understanding the phenomenon of coextinction, which may well be the most insidious threat to global biodiversity.},

We constructed a food web of the Mojave Desert terrestrial community (300 nodes, 4080 edges) to empirically examine the potential cascading effects of bird extinctions on this desert network, compared to losses of mammals and lizards. We focused on birds because they are already disappearing from the Mojave, and their relative thermal vulnerabilities are known. We quantified bottom-up secondary extinctions and evaluated the relative resistance of the community to losses of each vertebrate group. The impact of random bird species loss was relatively low compared to the consequences of mammal (causing the greatest number of cascading losses) or reptile loss, and birds were relatively less likely to be in trophic positions that could drive top-down effects in apparent competition and tri-tropic cascade motifs. An avian extinction cascade with year-long resident birds caused more secondary extinctions than the cascade involving all bird species for randomized ordered extinctions. Notably, we also found that relatively high interconnectivity among avian species has formed a subweb, enhancing network resistance to bird losses.},

Using 18 high-quality webs including several species traits, we identify which traits contribute the most to explaining network structure. We show that accounting for a few traits dramatically improves our understanding of the structure of ecological networks. Matching traits for resources and consumers, for example, fruit size and bill gape, are the most successful combinations.

Therefore, the extinction of a species can reverberate through the network and cause other (possibly distantly connected) species to go extinct as well. The study of these secondary extinctions is a fertile area of research in ecological network theory.                                                     However, to facilitate practical applications, several improvements to the current analytical approaches are needed. In particular, we need to consider that (i) species have different `a priori' probabilities of extinction, (ii) disturbances can simultaneously affect several species, and (iii) extinction risk of consumers likely grows with resource loss. All these points can be included in dynamical models, which are, however, difficult to parameterize.                                                     Here we advance the study of secondary extinctions with Bayesian networks. We show how this approach can account for different extinction responses using binary -- where each resource has the same importance -- and quantitative data -- where resources are weighted by their importance. We simulate ecological networks using a popular dynamical model (the Allometric Trophic Network model) and use it to test our method.                                                     We find that the Bayesian network model captures the majority of the secondary extinctions produced by the dynamical model and that consumers' responses to species loss are best modelled using a nonlinear sigmoid function. We also show that an approach based exclusively on food web structure loses power when species at higher trophic levels are preferentially lost. Because the loss of apex predators is unfortunately widespread, the results highlight a serious limitation of studies on network robustness.},

Here, we focus on the dynamics of ecological networks in response to environmental changes. Specifically, we formalize how network topologies constrain the dynamics of ecological systems into a unifying framework in network ecology that we refer to as the `ecological network dynamics framework'. This framework stresses that the interplay between species interaction networks and the spatial layout of habitat patches is key to identifying which network properties (number and weights of nodes and links) and trade-offs among them are needed to maintain species interactions in dynamic landscapes. We conclude that to be functional, ecological networks should be scaled according to species dispersal abilities in response to landscape heterogeneity. Determining how such effective ecological networks change through space and time can help reveal their complex dynamics in a changing world.},

With advancements in remote sensing technology and GIS, we now live in a data-rich era allowing us to investigate species--environment relationships in heterogeneous landscapes at multiple spatial scales. However, the degree and type of spatial heterogeneity changes depending on the spatial scale at which species--environment relationships are analysed. Here we present the current spatial analytic methods used in ecological studies to quantify ecological spatial heterogeneity. To determine the key spatial scales at which underlying ecological processes act upon species, we recommend use of spectral decomposition techniques such as wavelet analysis or Moran's eigenvector maps. Following this, a suite of spatial regression methods can be used to quantify the relative influence of environmental factors on species' distributions. Finally, spatial graph metrics can be employed to quantify the effects of spatial heterogeneity on landscape connectivity across or within species' ranges and can be used as additional predictors in spatial regression models. We emphasize how spatial statistics, spatial regression, and spatial graph theory can be used to provide insights into how landscape spatial complexity influences species distributions and to better understand species response to global change.},

Although extinctions explain much of this effect, range losses for extant species degraded food webs to a similar extent, highlighting the potential for food web restoration via extant species recovery.},

Rather, we observed that high degrees of species self-regulation and niche partitioning allow for maintaining larger levels of community feasibility and higher species persistence in more diverse communities.

How these trophic interaction modifications (TIMs) interact with one another to produce a net modifying effect is an important but under-explored issue. 2. We review several specific types of TIMs that are well understood to address whether the magnitude of the net modification changes with the number of modifiers, and whether modifiers usually increase or decrease each other's effects. 3. Modifications of interactions are generally not independent. It is likely that TIMs interact antagonistically in the majority of cases; the magnitudes of TIMs decrease as more modifiers are added, or new TIMs reduce the magnitudes of modifications that are already present. 4. Individual modifications are likely to have a smaller effect in many-species systems than expected from independent combination of modifications measured in systems with relatively few species. Thus, models that lack explicit TIMs may in some cases yield adequate predictions for species-level perturbations, provided that the net effects of TIMs are implicitly included in measured interaction strengths. 5. Many types of TIMs share structural similarities. Nevertheless, a complete understanding of their effects may require theory that distinguishes different `functional groups' of modifiers and addresses how these are structured according to trophic relationships.},

Both are driven by the way species interact with one another, but only recently community ecologists realized the need to document their spatial and temporal variation. Here, we call for an integrated approach, adopting the view that community structure is best represented as a network of ecological interactions, and show how it translates to biogeography questions. We propose that the ecological niche should encompass the effect of the environment on species distribution (the Grinnellian dimension of the niche) and on the ecological interactions among them (the Eltonian dimension). Starting from this concept, we develop a quantitative theory to explain turnover of interactions in space and time -- i.e. a novel approach to interaction distribution modeling. We apply this framework to host--parasite interactions across Europe and find that two aspects of the environment (temperature and precipitation) exert a strong imprint on species co-occurrence, but not on species interactions. Even where species co-occur, interaction proves to be stochastic rather than deterministic, adding to variation in realized network structure. We also find that a large majority of host-parasite pairs are never found together, thus precluding any inferences regarding their probability to interact. This first attempt to explain variation of network structure at large spatial scales opens new perspectives at the interface of species distribution modeling and community ecology.},

  abstract = {Current global changes make it important to be able to predict which interactions will occur in the emerging ecosystems. Most of the current methods to infer the existence of interactions between two species require a good knowledge of their behaviour or a direct observation of interactions. In this paper, we overcome these limitations by developing a method, inspired from the niche model of food web structure, using the statistical relationship between predator and prey body size to infer the matrix of potential interactions among a pool of species. The novelty of our approach is to infer, for any species of a given species pool, the three species-specific parameters of the niche model. The method applies to both local and metaweb scales. It allows one to evaluate the feeding interactions of a new species entering the community. We find that this method gives robust predictions of the structure of food webs and that its efficiency is increased when the strength of the body--size relationship between predators and preys increases. We finally illustrate the potential of the method to infer the metaweb structure of pelagic fishes of the Mediterranean sea under different global change scenarios.},

However their full potential has yet to be realised because of the huge amount of resources required to construct them de novo. Consequently, the current catalogue of networks that are suitable for rigorous and comparative analyses and theoretical development still suffers from a lack of standardisation and replication. Here, we present a novel R function, WebBuilder, which automates the construction of food webs from taxonomic lists, and a dataset of trophic interactions. This function works by matching species against those within a dataset of trophic interactions, and `filling in' missing trophic interactions based on these matches. We also present a dataset of over 20,000 freshwater trophic interactions, and use this and four well-characterised freshwater food webs to test the method. The WebBuilder function facilitates the generation of food webs of comparable quality to the most detailed published food webs, but at a fraction of the research effort or cost. Furthermore, it matched and often outperformed a selection of predictive models, which are currently among the best, in terms of capturing key properties of empirical food webs. The method is simple to use, systematic and, perhaps most importantly, reproducible, which will facilitate (re-) analysis and data sharing. Although developed and tested on a sample of freshwater food webs, this method could easily be extended to cover other types of ecological interactions (such as mutualistic interactions).},

Our aim is to derive a strategy that can help to dispel the existing ''confusion of tongues'' on the subject of ''stability'' and prevent its future recurrence. The strategy consists of three questions that should be kept in mind when communicating about stability properties. These three questions should overcome the three main sources of confusion in terminology. Firstly, which stability properties are being addressed in the stability statement? Our analysis shows that the general term ''stability'' is so ambiguous as to be useless.It can be replaced by the stability properties ''staying essentially unchanged'' (constancy), ''returning to the reference state (or dynamic) after a temporary disturbance'' (resilience), and ''persistence through time of an ecological system'' (persistence). Second, to what ecological situation does the statement refer? An ecological situation is defined by a set of features that, taken as a whole, determine the domain of validity of a stability statement. The six most important features form the ''ecological checklist'', which serves to classify ecological situations and thereby provides a system of coordinates for communication. The six points are: variable of interest, level of description, reference state, disturbance, spatial scale and temporal scale. Thirdly, is the statement anchored in the situation in question, or is there unacceptable generalisation by inferring ''stability'' of the whole system from a certain stability property in a certain ecological ecological situation? This question separates the scientifically valuable content of a statement from the desire for general statements which is often projected through stability statements.},

These individual-based networks merge with each other, forming species-based networks and food webs that describe the architecture of ecological communities. Networks at broader spatiotemporal scales portray the structure of ecological interactions across landscapes and over macroevolutionary time. Here, I review the patterns observed in ecological networks across multiple levels of biological organization. A fundamental challenge is to understand the amount of interdependence as we move from individual-based networks to species-based networks and beyond. Despite the uneven distribution of studies, regularities in network structure emerge across scales due to the fundamental architectural patterns shared by complex networks and the interplay between traits and numerical effects. I illustrate the integration of these organizational scales by exploring the consequences of the emergence of highly connected species for network structures across scales.

  abstract = {Background Range maps are a useful tool to describe the spatial distribution of species. However, they need to be used with caution, as they essentially represent a rough approximation of a species' suitable habitats. When stacked together, the resulting communities in each grid cell may not always be realistic, especially when species interactions are taken into account. Here we show the extent of the mismatch between range maps, provided by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and species interactions data. More precisely, we show that local networks built from those stacked range maps often yield unrealistic communities, where species of higher trophic levels are completely disconnected from primary producers. Methodology We used the well-described Serengeti food web of mammals and plants as our case study, and identify areas of data mismatch within predators' range maps by taking into account food web structure. We then used occurrence data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) to investigate where data is most lacking. Results We found that most predator ranges comprised large areas without any overlapping distribution of their prey. However, many of these areas contained GBIF occurrences of the predator. Conclusions Our results suggest that the mismatch between both data sources could be due either to the lack of information about ecological interactions or the geographical occurrence of prey. We finally discuss general guidelines to help identify defective data among distributions and interactions data, and we recommend this method as a valuable way to assess whether the occurrence data that are being used, even if incomplete, are ecologically accurate.},

We define the concept of thresholding as a process of determining a decision boundary in the presence of a tunable parameter. The threshold is the maximum value of this tunable parameter where the conditions of a certain decision are satisfied. We show that thresholding is applicable not only for linear classifiers but also for non-linear classifiers. We show that this is the implicit assumption for many approaches to deal with class imbalance in linear classifiers. We then extend this paradigm beyond linear classification and show how non-linear classification can be dealt with under this umbrella framework of thresholding. The proposed method can be used for outlier detection in many real-life scenarios like in manufacturing. In advanced manufacturing units, where the manufacturing process has matured over time, the number of instances (or parts) of the product that need to be rejected (based on a strict regime of quality tests) becomes relatively rare and are defined as outliers. How to detect these rare parts or outliers beforehand? How to detect combination of conditions leading to these outliers? These are the questions motivating our research. This paper focuses on prediction of outliers and conditions leading to outliers using classification. We address the problem of outlier detection using classification. The classes are good parts (those passing the quality tests) and bad parts (those failing the quality tests and can be considered as outliers). The rarity of outliers transforms this problem into a class-imbalanced classification problem.},

Four previously proposed shortfalls pinpoint knowledge gaps for species taxonomy (Linnean), distribution (Wallacean), abundance (Prestonian), and evolutionary patterns (Darwinian). We also redefine the Hutchinsonian shortfall to apply to the abiotic tolerances of species and propose new shortfalls relating to limited knowledge of species traits (Raunki{\ae}ran) and biotic interactions (Eltonian). We conclude with a general framework for the combined impacts and consequences of shortfalls of large-scale biodiversity knowledge for evolutionary and ecological research and consider ways of overcoming the seven shortfalls and dealing with the uncertainty they generate.},

  abstract = {Despite its supreme importance and the threat of its global crash, biodiversity remains poorly understood both empirically and theoretically. This ambitious book presents a new, general neutral theory to explain the origin, maintenance, and loss of biodiversity in a biogeographic context.  Until now biogeography (the study of the geographic distribution of species) and biodiversity (the study of species richness and relative species abundance) have had largely disjunct intellectual histories. In this book, Stephen Hubbell develops a formal mathematical theory that unifies these two fields. When a speciation process is incorporated into Robert H. MacArthur and Edward O. Wilson's now classical theory of island biogeography, the generalized theory predicts the existence of a universal, dimensionless biodiversity number. In the theory, this fundamental biodiversity number, together with the migration or dispersal rate, completely determines the steady-state distribution of species richness and relative species abundance on local to large geographic spatial scales and short-term to evolutionary time scales.  Although neutral, Hubbell's theory is nevertheless able to generate many nonobvious, testable, and remarkably accurate quantitative predictions about biodiversity and biogeography. In many ways Hubbell's theory is the ecological analog to the neutral theory of genetic drift in genetics. The unified neutral theory of biogeography and biodiversity should stimulate research in new theoretical and empirical directions by ecologists, evolutionary biologists, and biogeographers.},

This is essential for us to be able to predict, and eventually mitigate, the consequences of increasing environmental perturbations such as habitat loss, climate change, and invasions of exotic species. 2. Ecological networks can be subdivided into three broad types: 'traditional' food webs, mutualistic networks and host-parasitoid networks. There is a recent trend towards cross-comparisons among network types and also to take a more mechanistic, as opposed to phenomenological, perspective. For example, analysis of network configurations, such as compartments, allows us to explore the role of co-evolution in structuring mutualistic networks and host-parasitoid networks, and of body size in food webs. 3. Research into ecological networks has recently undergone a renaissance, leading to the production of a new catalogue of evermore complete, taxonomically resolved, and quantitative data. Novel topological patterns have been unearthed and it is increasingly evident that it is the distribution of interaction strengths and the configuration of complexity, rather than just its magnitude, that governs network stability and structure. 4. Another significant advance is the growing recognition of the importance of individual traits and behaviour: interactions, after all, occur between individuals. The new generation of high-quality networks is now enabling us to move away from describing networks based on species-averaged data and to start exploring patterns based on individuals. Such refinements will enable us to address more general ecological questions relating to foraging theory and the recent metabolic theory of ecology. 5. We conclude by suggesting a number of 'dead ends' and 'fruitful avenues' for future research into ecological networks.},

Assembling multispecies trait data from diverse literature sources into a single comprehensive data set requires detailed consideration of methods to reliably compile data for particular species, and to derive single estimates from multiple sources based on different techniques and definitions. Here we describe PanTHERIA, a species-level data set compiled for analysis of life history, ecology, and geography of all known extant and recently extinct mammals. PanTHERIA is derived from a database capable of holding multiple geo-referenced values for variables within a species containing 100 740 lines of biological data for extant and recently extinct mammalian species, collected over a period of three years by 20 individuals. PanTHERIA also includes spatial databases of mammalian geographic ranges and global climatic and anthropogenic variables. Here we detail how the data fields are extracted and defined for PanTHERIA using a customized data input format (MammalForm); how data were collected from the literature, species names and sources tracked, error-checking and validation procedures applied, and how data were consolidated into species-level values for each variable. Tables of the consolidated species-level values are made available for each of two recent species-level taxonomic classifications of mammals, as well as associated taxonomic synonymy conversion and data-input files. This study provides a useful guide to prospective researchers on how to structure and codify life-history, ecological, geographic, and taxonomic data and methods to extract meaningful species-level traits.

  abstract = {Basic research on biodiversity has concentrated on individual species---naming new species, studying distribution patterns, and analyzing their evolutionary relationships. Yet biodiversity is more than a collection of individual species; it is the combination of biological entities and processes that support life on Earth. To understand biodiversity we must catalog it, but we must also assess the ways species interact with other species to provide functional support for the Tree of Life. Ecological interactions may be lost well before the species involved in those interactions go extinct; their ecological functions disappear even though they remain. Here, I address the challenges in studying the functional aspects of species interactions and how basic research is helping us address the fast-paced extinction of species due to human activities.},

Combining experiments, animal tracking, and mortality investigations, we show that the invasive big-headed ant (Pheidole megacephala) makes lions (Panthera leo) less effective at killing their primary prey, plains zebra (Equus quagga). Big-headed ants disrupted the mutualism between native ants (Crematogaster spp.) and the dominant whistling-thorn tree (Vachellia drepanolobium), rendering trees vulnerable to elephant (Loxodonta africana) browsing and resulting in landscapes with higher visibility. Although zebra kills were significantly less likely to occur in higher-visibility, invaded areas, lion numbers did not decline since the onset of the invasion, likely because of prey-switching to African buffalo (Syncerus caffer). We show that by controlling biophysical structure across landscapes, a tiny invader reconfigured predator-prey dynamics among iconic species.},

We present the first effort, to our knowledge, describing a comprehensive ecological network that includes all known trophic and diverse non-trophic links among {$>$}100 coexisting species for the marine rocky intertidal community of the central Chilean coast. Our results suggest that non-trophic interactions exhibit highly nonrandom structures both alone and with respect to food web structure. The occurrence of different types of interactions, relative to all possible links, was well predicted by trophic structure and simple traits of the source and target species. In this community, competition for space and positive interactions related to habitat/refuge provisioning by sessile and/or basal species were by far the most abundant non-trophic interactions. If these patterns are corroborated in other ecosystems, they may suggest potentially important dynamic constraints on the combined architecture of trophic and non-trophic interactions. The nonrandom patterning of non-trophic interactions suggests a path forward for developing a more comprehensive ecological network theory to predict the functioning and resilience of ecological communities.},

In particular, ecologists aim to identify generalisable rules that explain which types of food webs are more or less robust to secondary extinctions. Food web structure, or the patterns formed by species and their interactions, has been extensively studied as a potential factor that influences robustness to species loss. We systematically reviewed 28 studies to identify the relationships between food web structure and robustness to species loss and how the conclusions depend on methodological differences. Contrary to popular belief and theory, we found relatively consistent, positive relationships between connectance and robustness, among other generalities. Yet, we also found that conflicting conclusions about structure-robustness relationships can be, in part, attributed to differences in the type of data that studies use, particularly studies that use empirical data versus those generated from theoretical models. This review points towards a need to standardise methodology to answer the open question of whether robustness and its relationship with food web structure and to provide applicable insights for managing complex systems.},

Detection of compartments was influenced by food web resolution, such as interactions with weights. Because the method identifies compartmental boundaries in which interactions are concentrated, it is compatible with the definition of compartments. The method is rigorous because it maximizes an explicit function, identifies the number of non-overlapping compartments, assigns membership to compartments, and tests the statistical significance of the results12,13,14. A graphical presentation14 reveals systemic relationships and taxa-specific positions as structured by compartments. From this graphic, we explore two scenarios of disturbance to develop a hypothesis for testing how compartmentalized interactions increase stability in food webs15,16,17.},

  abstract = {Recently, there has been a vigorous interest in community ecology about the structure of mutualistic networks and its importance for species persistence and coevolution. However, the mechanisms shaping mutualistic networks have been rarely explored. Here we extend for the first time the neutral theory of biodiversity to a multi trophic system. We focus on nestedness, a distinctive pattern of mutualistic community assembly showing two characteristics, namely, asymmetrical specialization (specialists interacting with generalists) and a generalist core (generalists interacting with generalists). We investigate the importance of relative species abundance (RSA) for the nested assembly of plant--animal mutualistic networks. Our results show that neutral mutualistic communities give rise to networks considerably more nested than real communities. RSA explains 60--70\% of nested patterns in two real communities studied here, while 30--40\% of nestedness is still unexplained. The nested pattern in real communities is better explained when we introduce interaction-specific species traits such as forbidden links and intensity of dependence (relative importance of fruits for the diet of a frugivore) in our analysis. The fact that neutral mutualistic communities exhibit a perfectly nested structure and do not show a random or compartmentalized structure, underlines the importance of RSA in the assembly of mutualistic networks.},

Here, we infer ecological networks using two data sets (YFDP, FIA) describing distributional and attribute information at local, regional, and continental scales for woody species across North America. We accomplish this inference using four different methodologies (COOCCUR, NETASSOC, HMSC, NDD-RIM), incorporating biological data along an occurrence-performance spectrum while accounting (or not) for various confounding parameters. We contrast 1-1 associations at each evaluated scale to quantify consistency amongst inference approaches. We also assess consistency across scales within each inference approach. Ultimately, we find that inferred networks are inconsistent across scales and methodologies, particularly at continental scales. We highlight how such inconsistencies between network inference methods may be linked to using occurrence or performance information and incorporating or not confounding factors. Finally, we argue that identifying the ``best'' inference method is non-trivial. Thus, to facilitate the choice of inference methods for a given purpose, we suggest aligning specific research questions and the scale applicability of the method when interpreting the inferred links, network topology, and ecological processes governing network assembly.},

  abstract = {Understanding how the differential magnitude and sign of ecological interactions vary across space is vital to assessing ecosystem resilience to biodiversity loss and predict community assemblies. This necessity for ecological network knowledge and their labour-intensive sampling requirements has spurred the creation of ecological network inference methodology. Recent research has identified inconsistencies in networks inferred using different approaches thus necessitating quantification of inference performance to facilitate choice of network inference approach.Here we develop a data simulation method to generate data products fit for network inference and subsequently quantify the validity of two well-established ecological interaction network inference methods -- HMSC and COOCCUR. The simulation framework we present here can be parameterised using real-world information (e.g., biological interactions observed in-situ and bioclimatic niche preferences) thus representing network inference capabilities in real-world applications. Using this framework, it is thus possible to evaluate the performance of any ecological network inference approach.We identify a concerningly large range in accuracy of inferred networks as compared to true, realisable association networks. These differences in inference accuracy are governed by a paradigm of input data types and environmental parameter estimation as previously suggested. To establish a workflow for quantification of network inference reliability, we suggest analysis procedures with which to explore inference and detection probabilities of association types of different identity and sign with respect to bioclimatic niche preferences and association strength of association partner-species.With this study, we provide the groundwork with which to validate and compare ecological network inference methods, and ultimately vastly increase our ability to understand and predict species biodiversity across space and time.},

We used the southern Barents Sea as a case study and inverse modelling as an analysis method. In spring, when the system was dominated by the herbivorous web, the diet of protozoa consisted of similar amounts of bacteria and phytoplankton. Copepods showed no clear preference for protozoa. Cod Gadus morhua, a predatory fish preying on copepods and on copepod-feeding capelin Mallotus villosus in spring, moderately depended on the microbial loop in spring, as only 20 to 60\% of its food passed through the microbial loop. In summer, when the food web was dominated by the microbial loop, protozoa ingested 4 times more bacteria than phytoplankton and protozoa formed 80 to 90\% of the copepod diet. Because of this strong link between the microbial loop and copepods (the young cod's main prey item) young cod ({$<$}3 yr) depended more on the microbial loop than on any other food web compartment, as {$>$}60\% of its food passed through the microbial loop in summer. Adult cod ({$\leq$}3 yr) relied far less on the microbial loop than young cod as it preyed on strictly herbivorous krill in summer. Food web efficiency for fish production was comparable between seasons ({\textasciitilde}5 {\texttimes} 10--4) and 2 times higher in summer (5 {\texttimes} 10--2) than in spring for copepod production.},

Plant ecologists have demonstrated the importance of traits in explaining community structure, competitive interactions as well as ecosystem functioning. The application of trait-based methods to more complex communities such as food webs is however more challenging owing to the diversity of animal characteristics and of interactions. The objective of this study was to determine how functional structure is related to food web structure. We consider that food web structure is the result of 1) the match between consumer and resource traits, which determine the occurence of a trophic interaction between them, and 2) the distribution of functional traits in the community. We implemented a statistical approach to assess whether or not 35 466 pairwise interactions between soil organisms are constrained by trait-matching and then used a Procrustes analysis to investigate correlations between functional indices and network properties across 48 sites. We found that the occurrence of trophic interactions is well predicted by matching the traits of the resource with those of the consumer. Taxonomy and body mass of both species were the most important traits for the determination of an interaction. As a consequence, functional evenness and the variance of certain traits in the community were correlated to trophic complementarity between species, while trait identity, more than diversity, was related to network topology. The analysis was however limited by trait data availability, and a coarse resolution of certain taxonomic groups in our dataset. These limitations explain the importance of taxonomy, as well as the complexity of the statistical model needed. Our results outline the important implications of trait composition on ecological networks, opening promising avenues of research into the relationship between functional diversity and ecosystem functioning in multi-trophic systems.},

  abstract = {Species interactions play a crucial role in shaping biodiversity, species coexistence, population dynamics, community stability and ecosystem functioning. Our understanding of the role of the diversity of species interactions driving these species, community and ecosystem features is limited because current approaches often focus only on trophic interactions. This is why a new modelling framework that includes a greater diversity of interactions between species is crucially needed.We developed a modular, user-friendly, and extensible Julia package that delivers the core functionality of the bio-energetic food web model. Moreover, it embeds several ecological interaction types alongside the capacity to manipulate external drivers of ecological dynamics like temperature. These new features represent important processes known to influence biodiversity, coexistence, functioning and stability in natural communities. Specifically, they include: a) an explicit multiple nutrient intake model for producers, b) competition among producers, c) temperature dependence implemented via the Boltzmann-Arhennius rule, and d) the ability to model several non-trophic interactions including competition for space, plant facilitation, predator interference and refuge provisioning.The inclusion of the various features provides users with the ability to ask questions about multiple simultaneous processes and stressor impacts, and thus develop theory relevant to real world scenarios facing complex ecological communities in the Anthropocene. It will allow researchers to quantify the relative importance of different mechanisms to stability and functioning of complex communities.The package was build for theoreticians seeking to explore the effects of different types of species interactions on the dynamics of complex ecological communities, but also for empiricists seeking to confront their empirical findings with theoretical expectations. The package provides a straightforward framework to model explicitly complex ecological communities or provide tools to generate those communities from few parameters.},

Mathematical network models can be used to simplify the vast complexity of the real world, to formally describe and investigate ecological phenomena, and to understand ecosystems propensity of returning to its functioning regime after a stress or a perturbation. The use of ecological-network models to study the relationship between complexity and stability of natural ecosystems is the focus of this review. The concept of ecological networks and their characteristics are first introduced, followed by central and occasionally contrasting definitions of complexity and stability. The literature on the relationship between complexity and stability in different types of models and in real ecosystems is then reviewed, highlighting the theoretical debate and the lack of consensual agreement. The summary of the importance of this line of research for the successful management and conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services concludes the review.},

  abstract = {Species interactions play a fundamental role in ecosystems. However, few ecological communities have complete data describing such interactions, which is an obstacle to understanding how ecosystems function and respond to perturbations. Because it is often impractical to collect empirical data for all interactions in a community, various methods have been developed to infer interactions. Machine learning is increasingly being used for making interaction predictions, with random forest being one of the most frequently used of these methods. However, performance of random forest in inferring predator-prey interactions in terrestrial vertebrates and its sensitivity to training data quality remain untested. We examined predator--prey interactions in two diverse, primarily terrestrial vertebrate classes: birds and mammals. Combining data from a global interaction dataset and a specific community (Simpson Desert, Australia), we tested how well random forest predicted predator--prey interactions for mammals and birds using species' ecomorphological and phylogenetic traits. We also tested how variation in training data quality -- manipulated by removing records and switching interaction records to non-interactions -- affected model performance. We found that random forest could predict predator--prey interactions for birds and mammals using ecomorphological or phylogenetic traits, correctly predicting up to 88 and 67\% of interactions and non-interactions in the global and community-specific datasets, respectively. These predictions were accurate even when there were no records in the training data for focal species. In contrast, false non-interactions for focal predators in training data strongly degraded model performance. Our results demonstrate that random forest can identify predator--prey interactions for birds and mammals that have few or no interaction records. Furthermore, our study provides guidance on how to prepare training data to optimise machine learning classifiers for predicting species interactions, which could help ecologists 1) address knowledge gaps and explore network-related questions in data-poor situations, and 2) predict interactions for range-expanding species.},

  abstract = {There is mounting evidence that biodiversity increases the stability of ecosystem processes in changing environments, but the mechanisms that underlie this effect are still controversial and poorly understood. Here, we extend mechanistic theory of ecosystem stability in competitive communities to clarify the mechanisms underlying diversity--stability relationships. We first explain why, contrary to a widely held belief, interspecific competition should generally play a destabilising role. We then explore the stabilising effect of differences in species' intrinsic rates of natural increase and provide a synthesis of various potentially stabilising mechanisms. Three main mechanisms are likely to operate in the stabilising effects of biodiversity on ecosystem properties: (1) asynchrony of species' intrinsic responses to environmental fluctuations, (2) differences in the speed at which species respond to perturbations, (3) reduction in the strength of competition. The first two mechanisms involve temporal complementarity between species, while the third results from functional complementarity. Additional potential mechanisms include selection effects, behavioural changes resulting from species interactions and mechanisms arising from trophic or non-trophic interactions and spatial heterogeneity. We conclude that mechanistic trait-based approaches are key to predicting the effects of diversity on ecosystem stability and to bringing the old diversity--stability debate to a final resolution.},

  abstract = {Motivation Documenting potential interactions between species represents a major step towards understanding and predicting the spatial and temporal structure of multi-trophic communities and their functioning. The metaweb concept summarizes the potential trophic (and non-trophic) interactions in a given species pool. As such, it generalizes the regional species pool of community ecology by incorporating the potential relationships between species from different trophic levels along with their functional characteristics. However, although this concept is very attractive theoretically, it has rarely been used to understand the structure of an ecological network, mostly because of data availability. Here, we provide a continental-scale, species-level metaweb for all tetrapods (mammals, breeding birds, reptiles and amphibians) occurring in Europe and in the Northern Mediterranean basin. This metaweb is based on data extracted from the scientific literature, including published papers, books and grey literature. Main type of variable contained For each species considered, we built the network of potential two-way trophic interactions. Spatial location and grain We considered all species occurring in the entire European subcontinent, from Macaronesia (including only the islands belonging politically to Spain and Portugal) to the Ural Mountains (west to east) and from Fennoscandia and U.K. islands to the Mediterranean (north to south). We included Turkey, geographically part of Asia, to provide a complete picture of the north-eastern Mediterranean coast. Time period The data represent information published and/or collected during the last 50 years. Major taxa studied and level of measurement We focused our metaweb on terrestrial tetrapods occurring in the study area. Only species introduced in historical times and currently naturalized were considered; new introductions were excluded. In total, we included 288 mammals, 509 regularly breeding birds, 250 reptiles and 104 amphibians. Software format Data are supplied as semicolon-separated text files.},

Within the amino terminal half of the molecule the locations of helices predicted by a number of methods agree moderately well with the observed structure, however within the carboxyl half of the molecule the overall agreement is poor. For eleven different helix predictions, the coefficients giving the correlation between prediction and observation range from 0.14 to 0.42. The accuracy of the predictions for both {$\beta$}-sheet regions and for turns are generally lower than for the helices, and in a number of instances the agreement between prediction and observation is no better than would be expected for a random selection of residues. The structural predictions for T4 phage lysozyme are much less successful than was the case for adenylate kinase (Schulz et al. (1974) Nature 250, 140--142). No one method of prediction is clearly superior to all others, and although empirical predictions based on larger numbers of known protein structure tend to be more accurate than those based on a limited sample, the improvement in accuracy is not dramatic, suggesting that the accuracy of current empirical predictive methods will not be substantially increased simply by the inclusion of more data from additional protein structure determinations.},

The motifs shared by ecological food webs were distinct from the motifs shared by the genetic networks of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae or from those found in the World Wide Web. Similar motifs were found in networks that perform information processing, even though they describe elements as different as biomolecules within a cell and synaptic connections between neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans. Motifs may thus define universal classes of networks. This approach may uncover the basic building blocks of most networks.},

We consider the problem of inferring the species interaction network from abundance data.

It also needs to distinguish between direct interactions and indirect associations and graphical models provide a convenient framework for this purpose. A simulation study shows that the proposed methodology compares well with state-of-the-art approaches, even when the underlying graph strongly differs from a tree. The analysis of two datasets highlights the influence of covariates on the inferred network. Accounting for covariates is critical to avoid spurious edges.

Many mechanisms have been proposed as explanations of observed network patterns; however, the fact that plant--animal interactions are inherently spatial has so far been ignored. Using a simulation model of frugivorous birds foraging in spatially explicit landscapes we evaluated how plant distribution and the scale of bird movement decisions influenced species interaction probabilities and the resulting network properties. Spatial aggregation and limited animal mobility restricted encounter probabilities, so that the distribution of animal visits per plant deviated strongly from the binomial distribution expected for a well-mixed system. Lack of mixing in turn resulted in a strong decrease in network connectance, a weak decrease in nestedness, stronger interactions, greater strength asymmetry and the unexpected presence/absence of some interactions. Our results suggest that spatial processes may contribute substantially to structure plant--animal mutualistic networks.},

  abstract = {Ecological communities are constantly being reshaped in the face of environmental change and anthropogenic pressures. Yet, how food webs change over time remains poorly understood. Food web science is characterized by a trade-off between complexity (in terms of the number of species and feeding links) and dynamics. Topological analysis can use complex, highly resolved empirical food web models to explore the architecture of feeding interactions but is limited to a static view, whereas ecosystem models can be dynamic but use highly aggregated food webs. Here, we explore the temporal dynamics of a highly resolved empirical food web over a time period of 18 years, using the German Bight fish and benthic epifauna community as our case study. We relied on long-term monitoring ecosystem surveys (from 1998 to 2015) to build a metaweb, i.e. the meta food web containing all species recorded over the time span of our study. We then combined time series of species abundances with topological network analysis to construct annual food web snapshots. We developed a new approach, `node-weighted' food web metrics by including species abundances to represent the temporal dynamics of food web structure, focusing on generality and vulnerability. Our results suggest that structural food web properties change through time; however, binary food web structural properties may not be as temporally variable as the underlying changes in species composition. Further, the node-weighted metrics enabled us to detect that food web structure was influenced by changes in species composition during the first half of the time series and more strongly by changes in species dominance during the second half. Our results demonstrate how ecosystem surveys can be used to monitor temporal changes in food web structure, which are important ecosystem indicators for building marine management and conservation plans.},

Knowledge of how trophic interaction strengths are affected by differences among habitats is crucial for understanding variation in ecological systems. Here we show how substantial variation in consumption-rate data, and hence trophic interaction strengths, arises because consumers tend to encounter resources more frequently in three dimensions (3D) (for example, arboreal and pelagic zones) than two dimensions (2D) (for example, terrestrial and benthic zones). By combining new theory with extensive data (376 species, with body masses ranging from 5.24 {\texttimes} 10-14 kg to 800 kg), we find that consumption rates scale sublinearly with consumer body mass (exponent of approximately 0.85) for 2D interactions, but superlinearly (exponent of approximately 1.06) for 3D interactions. These results contradict the currently widespread assumption of a single exponent (of approximately 0.75) in consumer--resource and food-web research. Further analysis of 2,929 consumer--resource interactions shows that dimensionality of consumer search space is probably a major driver of species coexistence, and the stability and abundance of populations.},

In the Barents Sea, poleward expansion of boreal species and a decreased abundance of Arctic species are causing a rapid borealization of the Arctic communities. This borealization might have profound consequences on the Arctic food web by creating novel feeding interactions between previously non co-occurring species. An early identification of new feeding links is crucial to predict their ecological impact. However, detection by traditional approaches, including stomach content and isotope analyses, although fundamental, cannot cope with the speed of change observed in the region, nor with the urgency of understanding the consequences of species redistribution for the marine ecosystem. In this study, we used an extensive food web (metaweb) with nearly 2,500 documented feeding links between 239 taxa coupled with a trait data set to predict novel feeding interactions and to quantify their potential impact on Arctic food web structure. We found that feeding interactions are largely determined by the body size of interacting species, although species foraging habitat and metabolic type are also important predictors. Further, we found that all boreal species will have at least one potential resource in the Arctic region should they redistribute therein. During 2014--2017, 11 boreal species were observed in the Arctic region of the Barents Sea. These incoming species, which are all generalists, change the structural properties of the Arctic food web by increasing connectance and decreasing modularity. In addition, these boreal species are predicted to initiate novel feeding interactions with the Arctic residents, which might amplify their impact on Arctic food web structure affecting ecosystem functioning and vulnerability. Under the ongoing species redistribution caused by environmental change, we propose merging a trait-based approach with ecological network analysis to efficiently predict the impacts of range-shifting species on food webs.},

  abstract = {Network reconstruction consists in determining the unobserved pairwise couplings between \$N\$ nodes given only observational data on the resulting behavior that is conditioned on those couplings -- typically a time-series or independent samples from a graphical model. A major obstacle to the scalability of algorithms proposed for this problem is a seemingly unavoidable quadratic complexity of \${\textbackslash}Omega(N{\textasciicircum}2)\$, corresponding to the requirement of each possible pairwise coupling being contemplated at least once, despite the fact that most networks of interest are sparse, with a number of non-zero couplings that is only \$O(N)\$. Here we present a general algorithm applicable to a broad range of reconstruction problems that significantly outperforms this quadratic baseline. Our algorithm relies on a stochastic second neighbor search (Dong et al., 2011) that produces the best edge candidates with high probability, thus bypassing an exhaustive quadratic search. If we rely on the conjecture that the second-neighbor search finishes in log-linear time (Baron \& Darling, 2020; 2022), we demonstrate theoretically that our algorithm finishes in subquadratic time, with a data-dependent complexity loosely upper bounded by \$O(N{\textasciicircum}\{3/2\}{\textbackslash}log N)\$, but with a more typical log-linear complexity of \$O(N{\textbackslash}log{\textasciicircum}2N)\$. In practice, we show that our algorithm achieves a performance that is many orders of magnitude faster than the quadratic baseline -- in a manner consistent with our theoretical analysis -- allows for easy parallelization, and thus enables the reconstruction of networks with hundreds of thousands and even millions of nodes and edges.},

Recent advances include development of new methods for measuring fit of models to observed food web data, and thereby testing which are the `best' food web models. The best model could be considered the most efficient with relatively few parameters and high explanatory power. Another recent advance involves adding some additional biology to food web models in the form of foraging theory based on maximisation of energy intake as the predictor of species' diets in food webs. While it is interesting to compare efficiency among food web models, we believe that such comparisons at least should be interpreted with caution, since they do not account for any differences in motivation, formulation, and potential that might also exist among models. Furthermore, we see an important but somewhat neglected role for experimental tests of models of food web structure.},

Optimal foraging theory was conceived to increase such understanding by providing a framework with which to predict species interactions and resulting community structure. Here, we use an optimal foraging model and allometries of foraging variables to predict the structure of real food webs. The qualitative structure of the resulting model provides a more mechanistic basis for the phenomenological rules of previous models. Quantitative analyses show that the model predicts up to 65\% of the links in real food webs. The deterministic nature of the model allows analysis of the model's successes and failures in predicting particular interactions. Predacious and herbivorous feeding interactions are better predicted than pathogenic, parasitoid, and parasitic interactions. Results also indicate that accurate prediction and modeling of some food webs will require incorporating traits other than body size and diet choice models specific to different types of feeding interaction. The model results support the hypothesis that individual behavior, subject to natural selection, determines individual diets and that food web structure is the sum of these individual decisions.},

However, this binary approach oversimplifies complex ecological dynamics and fails to capture the nuanced structure of food webs. The challenge lies in the scarcity and limited availability of data on non-binary interactions, which are crucial for a more comprehensive understanding of ecological networks. This study explores the use of binary classifiers, particularly the XGBOOST algorithm to address the limitations of traditional binary approaches to prey-predator relationships. By predicting predation probabilities among nine mammalian predators using species traits, my findings demonstrate the classifiers' robust predictive capabilities to binary predictions but also a good correlation between probabilistic predation derived from binary classifiers and observed prey preferences. It also highlighted the importance of selecting informative species traits for predicting interaction, with performance contrastingly superior to null models. Despite a small sample size, this work provides insightful results and sets a foundation for future research to expand these models to broader ecological networks, emphasizing the need for comprehensive prey preference data.},

  abstract = {Ecologists have long suspected that species are more likely to interact if their traits match in a particular way. For example, a pollination interaction may be more likely if the proportions of a bee's tongue fit a plant's flower shape. Empirical estimates of the importance of trait-matching for determining species interactions, however, vary significantly among different types of ecological networks. Here, we show that ambiguity among empirical trait-matching studies may have arisen at least in parts from using overly simple statistical models. Using simulated and real data, we contrast conventional generalized linear models (GLM) with more flexible Machine Learning (ML) models (Random Forest, Boosted Regression Trees, Deep Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, na{\"i}ve Bayes, and k-Nearest-Neighbor), testing their ability to predict species interactions based on traits, and infer trait combinations causally responsible for species interactions. We found that the best ML models can successfully predict species interactions in plant--pollinator networks, outperforming GLMs by a substantial margin. Our results also demonstrate that ML models can better identify the causally responsible trait-matching combinations than GLMs. In two case studies, the best ML models successfully predicted species interactions in a global plant--pollinator database and inferred ecologically plausible trait-matching rules for a plant--hummingbird network from Costa Rica, without any prior assumptions about the system. We conclude that flexible ML models offer many advantages over traditional regression models for understanding interaction networks. We anticipate that these results extrapolate to other ecological network types. More generally, our results highlight the potential of machine learning and artificial intelligence for inference in ecology, beyond standard tasks such as image or pattern recognition.},

The framework provides a set of concepts and tools that can be adapted and applied to ecology, facilitating research on high-dimensional, heterogeneous systems in nature. Here, we formally define ecological multilayer networks based on a review of previous, related approaches; illustrate their application and potential with analyses of existing data; and discuss limitations, challenges, and future applications.

Understanding the ecological causes and consequences of megafaunal extinctions requires integrating approaches to reconstruct the ecological communities from the past. Here, we combined archeological and paleontological evidence with network analyses to understand the changes in ecological communities from late Pleistocene to the Holocene in South Patagonia, the last continental region where the encounter between humans and extinct megafauna occurred. The zooarcheological record suggests humans would have interacted mainly with large-bodied species, which comprise a small subset of the available prey. Accordingly, using network reconstructions and structural analyses, we found that human arrival would have produced minor changes in the overall structure of trophic networks. However, those few novel interactions established by humans would have created multiple indirect paths among megafaunal species. Indirect paths are the route for indirect effects such as competition and increase the vulnerability of interaction networks to perturbations. After the extinctions of most of the megafauna, the impoverished network became structurally simpler and densely connected. Our reconstructions of past trophic networks show that multiple indirect effects, potentially contributing to extinctions, can emerge even from a limited number of novel interactions and illustrate how network organization can affect and be affected by extinctions events.},

With a detailed understanding of these interactions, ecologists and biologists can make better informed predictions about the ways different environmental factors will impact ecosystems. Despite the abundance of research data on biotic and abiotic interactions, no comprehensive and easily accessible data collection is available that spans taxonomic, geospatial, and temporal domains. Biotic-interaction datasets are effectively siloed, inhibiting cross-dataset comparisons. In order to pool resources and bring to light individual datasets, specialized research tools are needed to aggregate, normalize, and integrate existing datasets with standard taxonomies, ontologies, vocabularies, and structured data repositories. Global Biotic Interactions (GloBI) provides such tools by way of an open, community-driven infrastructure designed to lower the barrier for researchers to perform ecological systems analysis and modeling. GloBI provides a tool that (a) ingests, normalizes, and aggregates datasets, (b) integrates interoperable data with accepted ontologies (e.g., OBO Relations Ontology, Uberon, and Environment Ontology), vocabularies (e.g., Coastal and Marine Ecological Classification Standard), and taxonomies (e.g., Integrated Taxonomic Information System and National Center for Biotechnology Information Taxonomy Database), (c) makes data accessible through an application programming interface (API) and various data archives (Darwin Core, Turtle, and Neo4j), and (d) houses a data collection of about 700,000 species interactions across about 50,000 taxa, covering over 1100 references from 19 data sources. GloBI has taken an open-source and open-data approach in order to make integrated species-interaction data maximally accessible and to encourage users to provide feedback, contribute data, and improve data access methods. The GloBI collection of datasets is currently used in the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL) and Gulf of Mexico Species Interactions (GoMexSI).},

This effort is supported by increased access to standardized information on ecological networks, in the form of openly accessible databases. Yet, there has been no systematic evaluation of the fitness for purpose of these data to explore synthesis questions at very large spatial scales. In particular, because the sampling of ecological networks is a difficult task, they are likely to not have a good representation of the diversity of Earth's bioclimatic conditions, likely to be spatially aggregated, and therefore unlikely to achieve broad representativeness. In this paper, we analyse over 1300 ecological networks in the mangal.io database, and discuss their coverage of climates, and the geographic areas in which there is a deficit of data on ecological networks. Taken together, our results suggest that while some information about the global structure of ecological networks is available, it remains fragmented over space, with further differences by types of ecological interactions. This causes great concerns both for our ability to transfer knowledge from one region to the next, but also to forecast the structural change in networks under climate change.},

Yet, ecological networks are challenging to predict because they are typically small and sparse. Dealing with extreme class imbalance is a challenge for most binary classifiers, and there are currently no guidelines as to how predictive models can be trained for this specific problem. Using simple mathematical arguments and numerical experiments in which a variety of classifiers (for supervised learning) are trained on simulated networks, we develop a series of guidelines related to the choice of measures to use for model selection, and the ways to assemble the training dataset. Neither classifier accuracy nor the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) are informative measures for the performance of interaction prediction. The area under the precision-recall curve (PR-AUC) is a fairer assessment of performance. In some cases, even standard measures can lead to selecting a more biased classifier because the effect of connectance is strong. The amount of correction to apply to the training dataset depends on network connectance, on the measure to be optimized, and only weakly on the classifier. These results reveal that training machines to predict networks is a challenging task, and that in virtually all cases, the composition of the training set needs to be fine-tuned before performing the actual training. We discuss these consequences in the context of the low volume of data.},

Here, we investigate whether species interactions vary more in response to different climate variables than do individual species. Location Eurasia. Time period 2000s. Major taxa Animalia.

We measured uniqueness based on the species composition and based on potential and realized biotic interactions (here, host--parasite interactions). Results We show that species interactions vary more, across space, than do species. In particular, we show that species interactions respond to some climatic variables that have no effect on species distributions or dissimilarity. Main conclusions Species interactions capture some degree of variation that is not apparent when looking at species occurrences only. In this system, this appeared as hosts and parasites interacting in different ways as a response to different environmental factors, especially the temperature and dryness.

It requires the ability to understand how and why species interact, as this will allow the development of mechanism-based predictive models, and as such to better characterize how ecological mechanisms act locally on the existence of inter-specific interactions. Here we argue that the current conceptualization of species interaction networks is ill-suited for this task. Instead, we propose that future research must start to account for the intrinsic variability of species interactions, then scale up from here onto complex networks. This can be accomplished simply by recognizing that there exists intra-specific variability, in traits or properties related to the establishment of species interactions. By shifting the scale towards population-based processes, we show that this new approach will improve our predictive ability and mechanistic understanding of how species interact over large spatial or temporal scales. Synthesis Although species interactions are the backbone of ecological communities, we have little insights on how (and why) they vary through space and time. In this article, we build on existing empirical literature to show that the same species may happen to interact in different ways when their local abundances vary, their trait distribution changes, or when the environment affects either of these factors. We discuss how these findings can be integrated in existing frameworks for the analysis and simulation of species interactions.},

  abstract = {Summary There is a growing realization among community ecologists that interactions between species vary across space and time and that this variation needs to be quantified. Our current numerical framework to analyse the structure of species interactions, based on graph-theoretical approaches, usually do not consider the variability of interactions. As this variability has been show to hold valuable ecological information, there is a need to adapt the current measures of network structure so that they can exploit it. We present analytical expressions of key measures of network structured, adapted so that they account for the variability of ecological interactions. We do so by modelling each interaction as a Bernoulli event; using basic calculus allows expressing the expected value, and when mathematically tractable, its variance. When applied to non-probabilistic data, the measures we present give the same results as their non-probabilistic formulations, meaning that they can be generally applied. We present three case studies that highlight how these measures can be used, in re-analysing data that experimentally measured the variability of interactions, to alleviate the computational demands of permutation-based approaches, and to use the frequency at which interactions are observed over several locations to infer the structure of local networks. We provide a free and open-source implementation of these measures. We discuss how both sampling and data representation of ecological networks can be adapted to allow the application of a fully probabilistic numerical network approach.}

  abstract = {Food webs in the real world are much more complex than food-web literature would have us believe. This is illustrated by the web of the sand community in the Coachella Valley desert. The biota include 174 species of vascular plants, 138 species of vertebrates, more than 55 species of arachnids, and an unknown (but great) number of microorganisms, insects (2,000-3,000 estimated species), acari, and nematodes. Trophic relations are presented in a series of nested subwebs and delineations of the community. Complexity arises from the large number of interactive species, the frequency of omnivory, age structure, looping, the lack of compartmentalization, and the complexity of the arthropod and soil faunas. Web features found in the Coachella also characterize other communities and should produce equivalently complex webs. If anything, diversity and complexity in most nondesert habitats are greater than those in deserts. Patterns from the Coachella web are compared with theoretical predictions and "empirical generalizations" derived from catalogs of published webs. The Coachella web differs greatly: chains are longer, omnivory and loops are not rare, connectivity is greater (species interact with many more predators and prey), top predators are rare or nonexistent, and prey-topredator ratios are greater than 1.0. The evidence argues that actual community food webs are extraordinarily more complex than those webs cataloged by theorists. I argue that most cataloged webs are oversimplified caricatures of actual communities. That cataloged webs depict so few species, absurdly low ratios of predators on prey and prey eaten by predators, so few links, so little omnivory, a veritable absence of looping, and such a high proportion of top predators argues strongly that they poorly represent real biological communities. Consequently, the practice of abstracting empirical regularities from such catalogs yields an inaccurate and artifactual view of trophic interactions within communities. Contrary to strong assertions by many theorists, patterns from food webs of real communities generally do not support predictions arising from dynamic and graphic models of food-web structure.}

  abstract = {A primary goal of ecology is to understand the fundamental processes underlying the geographic distributions of species. Two major strands of ecology -- habitat modelling and community ecology -- approach this problem differently. Habitat modellers often use species distribution models (SDMs) to quantify the relationship between species' and their environments without considering potential biotic interactions. Community ecologists, on the other hand, tend to focus on biotic interactions and, in observational studies, use co-occurrence patterns to identify ecological processes. Here, we describe a joint species distribution model (JSDM) that integrates these distinct observational approaches by incorporating species co-occurrence data into a SDM. JSDMs estimate distributions of multiple species simultaneously and allow decomposition of species co-occurrence patterns into components describing shared environmental responses and residual patterns of co-occurrence. We provide a general description of the model, a tutorial and code for fitting the model in R. We demonstrate this modelling approach using two case studies: frogs and eucalypt trees in Victoria, Australia. Overall, shared environmental correlations were stronger than residual correlations for both frogs and eucalypts, but there were cases of strong residual correlation. Frog species generally had positive residual correlations, possibly due to the fact these species occurred in similar habitats that were not fully described by the environmental variables included in the JSDM. Eucalypt species that interbreed had similar environmental responses but had negative residual co-occurrence. One explanation is that interbreeding species may not form stable assemblages despite having similar environmental affinities. Environmental and residual correlations estimated from JSDMs can help indicate whether co-occurrence is driven by shared environmental responses or other ecological or evolutionary process (e.g. biotic interactions), or if important predictor variables are missing. JSDMs take into account the fact that distributions of species might be related to each other and thus overcome a major limitation of modelling species distributions independently.},

  abstract = {Food webs are a powerful way to represent the diversity, structure, and function of ecological systems. However, the accurate description of food webs requires significant effort in time and resources, limiting their widespread use in ecological studies. Newly published methods allow for the inference of feeding interactions using proxy variables. Here, we compare the accuracy of two recently described methods, as well as describe a composite model of the two, for the inference of feeding interactions using a large, well-described dataset. Both niche and neutral processes are involved in determining whether or not two species will form a feeding link in communities. Three different models for determining niche constraints of feeding interactions are compared, and all three models are extended by incorporating neutral processes, based on relative abundances. The three models compared here infer niche processes through (a) phylogenetic relationships, (b) local species trait distributions (e.g., body size), and (c) a composite of phylogeny and local traits. We show that all three methods perform well at predicting individual species interactions, and that these individual predictions scale up to the network level, resulting in food web structure of inferred networks being similar to their empirical counterparts. Our results indicate that inferring food web structure using phylogenies can be an efficient way of getting summary webs with minimal data, and offers a conservative test of changes in food web structure, particularly when there is low species turnover between sites. Inferences made using traits require more data, but allows for greater understanding of the mechanisms underlying trophic interactions. A composite model of the two methods provides a framework for investigating the importance of how phylogeny, trait distributions, and relative abundances, affect species interactions, and network structure.},

  abstract = {Robust predictions of predator--prey interactions are fundamental for the understanding of food webs, their structure, dynamics, resistance to species loss, response to invasions and ecosystem function. Most current food web models measure parameters at the food web level to predict patterns at the same level. Thus, they are sensitive to the quality of the data and may be ineffective in predicting non-observed interactions and disturbed food webs. There is a need for mechanistic models that predict the occurrence of a predator--prey interaction based on lower levels of organization (i.e. the traits of organisms) and the properties of their environment. Here, we present such a model that focuses on the predation act itself. We built a Newtonian, mechanical model for the processes of searching, capturing and handling of a prey item by a predator. Associated with general metabolic laws, we predict the net energy gain from predation for pairs of pelagic or flying predator species and their prey depending on their body sizes. Predicted interactions match well with data from the most extensive predator--prey database, and overall model accuracy is greater than the allometric niche model. Our model shows that it is possible to accurately predict the structure of food webs using only a few mechanical traits. It underlines the importance of physical constraints in structuring food webs.

Early debates over food-web data focused on taxonomic resolution and completeness, lack of which had produced spurious inferences. Recent data are widely believed to be much better and are used extensively in theoretical and meta-analytic research on network ecology. Confidence in these data rests on the assumptions (a) that empiricists correctly identified consumers and their foods and (b) that sampling methods were adequate to detect a near-comprehensive fraction of the trophic interactions between species. Abundant evidence indicates that these assumptions are often invalid, suggesting that most topological food-web data may remain unreliable for inferences about network structure and underlying ecological and evolutionary processes. Morphologically cryptic species are ubiquitous across taxa and regions, and many trophic interactions routinely evade detection by conventional methods. Molecular methods have diagnosed the severity of these problems and are a necessary part of the cure.},

The review considers recent theoretical and empirical developments, dealing with behaviour of animals while they are foraging (but ignoring the timing of and the amount of time allocated to such behaviour).

  abstract = {Species-level networks emerge as the combination of interactions spanning multiple individuals, and their study has received considerable attention over the past 30 years. However, less is known about the structure of individual interaction configurations within species, being the fundamental scale at which ecological interactions occur in nature. We compiled 46 empirical, individual-based, interaction networks on plant-animal seed dispersal mutualisms, comprising 1037 plant individuals across 29 species from various regions. We compare the structure of individual-based networks to that of species-based networks and, by extending the niche concept to interaction assemblages, we explore individual plant specialization. Using a Bayesian framework to account for uncertainty derived from sampling, we examine how plant individuals ``explore'' the interaction niche of their population. Both individual-based and species-based networks exhibited high variability in network properties, lacking remarkable structural and topological differences between them. Within populations, frugivores' interaction allocation among plant individuals was highly heterogeneous, with one to three frugivore species dominating interactions. Regardless of species or bioregion, plant individuals displayed a variety of interaction profiles across populations, with a consistently small percentage of individuals playing a central role and exhibiting high diversity in their interaction assemblage. Plant populations showed varying mid to low levels of niche specialization; on average individuals' interaction niche ``breadth'' accounted for 70\% of the interaction diversity. Our results emphasize the importance of downscaling from species to individual-based networks to understand the structuring of interactions within ecological communities and provide an empirical basis for the extension of niche theory to complex mutualistic networks. Significance Statement Ecological interactions in nature occur between individual partners rather than species, and their outcomes determine fitness variation. By examining among-individual variation in interaction niches, we can bridge evolutionary and ecological perspectives to understand interaction biodiversity. This study investigates individual plant variation in frugivore assemblages worldwide, exploring how plant individuals ``build'' their interaction profiles with animal frugivores. The structure of networks composed of individuals was surprisingly similar to networks composed of species. Within populations, only a few plants played a key role in attracting a high diversity of frugivores, making them central to the overall network structure. Individuals actually explored a substantial diversity of partners, with individual interaction ``breadth'' accounting for up to 70\% of total interaction diversity on average.},

This approach is interesting, but it is limited by the fact that different assumptions can yield similar results. To overcome this limitation, we develop a purely statistical approach. Body size in terms of an optimal ratio between prey and predator is used as explanatory variable. In 12 observed food webs, this model predicts, on average, 20\% of interactions. To analyze the unexplained part, we introduce a latent term: each species is described by two latent traits, foraging and vulnerability, that represent nonmeasured characteristics of species once the optimal body size has been accounted for. The model now correctly predicts an average of 73\% of links. The key features of our approach are that latent traits quantify the structure that is left unexplained by the explanatory variable and that this quantification allows a test of whether independent biological information, such as microhabitat use, camouflage, or phylogeny, explains this structure. We illustrate this method with phylogeny and find that it is linked to one or both latent traits in nine of 12 food webs. Our approach opens the door to the formulation of more complex models that can be applied to any kind of biological network.},

  abstract = {Ecologists have long searched for structures and processes that impart stability in nature. In particular, food web ecology has held promise in tackling this issue. Empirical patterns in food webs have consistently shown that the distributions of species and interactions in nature are more likely to be stable than randomly constructed systems with the same number of species and interactions. Food web ecology still faces two fundamental challenges, however. First, the quantity and quality of food web data required to document both the species richness and the interaction strengths among all species within food webs is largely prohibitive. Second, where food webs have been well documented, spatial and temporal variation in food web structure has been ignored. Conversely, research that has addressed spatial and temporal variation in ecosystems has generally ignored the full complexity of food web architecture. Here, we incorporate empirical patterns, largely from macroecology and behavioural ecology, into a spatially implicit food web structure to construct a simple landscape theory of food web architecture. Such an approach both captures important architectural features of food webs and allows for an exploration of food web structure across a range of spatial scales. Finally, we demonstrated that food webs are hierarchically organized along the spatial and temporal niche axes of species and their utilization of food resources in ways that stabilize ecosystems.},

They have been used as primary tools in studies of the relationship between biodiversity and ecological stability, and the robustness and resilience of communities in the face of environmental disturbance. Those topics are central to theoretical studies in conservation biology and biodiversity ecology, and hence conservation paleobiology. Food webs can be constructed from paleocommunity data for studies relevant to conservation paleobiology and biology, given that proper attention is paid to limitations imposed by fossil preservation and the geological record, and that questions are asked at appropriate scales. This paper presents a mathematical model, CEG (Cascading Extinction on Graphs) for the reconstruction and analysis of paleocommunity food webs. The model utilizes combinatoric and network-based mathematics, combining network topological and population demographic processes. CEG is founded upon ecological first principles and effectively mimics fundamental trophic processes, such as trophic cascades, keystone predator effects, bottom-up community collapse, and parasite-mediated suppression of populations. The model is applied to two example paleocommunities, a terrestrial community from the Late Permian of the Karoo Basin in South Africa, and a Neogene coastal marine community from the Dominican Republic. Insights, assumptions and limitations of the model are explored.},

  abstract = {A model is developed to explore the potential responses of paleocommunities to disruptions of primary production during times of mass extinction and ecological crisis. Disruptions of primary production are expected to generate bottom-up cascades of secondary extinction, and these are predictable given species richnesses, functional diversity, and trophic link distributions. If, however, consumers are permitted to compensate for the loss of trophic resources by increasing the intensities of their remaining biotic interactions, top-down driven catastrophic increases of secondary extinction emerge from the model. Both bottom-up and top-down effects are themselves controlled by the geometry of the food webs. The general Phanerozoic trends of increasing taxonomic and ecological diversities, as well as the varying strengths of biotic interactions, have led to food webs of increasing complexity. The frequency of catastrophic secondary extinction increases as food web complexity increases, but increased complexity also serves to dampen the magnitude of the secondary extinctions. When intraguild competitive interactions are included in the model, competitively inferior taxa are observed to possess greater probabilities of survival if the guilds are embedded in simple subnetworks of the overall food web. The result is the emergence of post-extinction guilds dominated by those inferior taxa. These results are congruent with empirical observations of "disaster taxa" dominance after some mass extinction events, and provide a mechanism for the reorganization of ecosystems that is observed after those events. The model makes the testable prediction that dominance by disaster taxa, however, should be observed only when bottom-up disruptions have caused ecosystems to collapse catastrophically.},

We highlight how such techniques can be applied to simultaneously improve the taxonomic resolution of the nodes of the web (i.e., the species), and the links between them (i.e., who eats whom). We end by proposing how DNA barcodes and DNA information may allow new approaches to the construction of larger interaction webs, and overcome some hurdles to achieving adequate sample size. Most importantly, we propose that the joint adoption and development of these techniques may serve to unite approaches to food web studies in aquatic and terrestrial systems---revealing the extent to which food webs in these environments are structured similarly to or differently from each other, and how they are linked by dispersal.},

With the increasing availability of high-resolution ecological time series, there is a growing need to understand how scale and resolution in the data affect the construction and interpretation of causal networks---specifically, networks mapping how changes in one variable drive changes in others as part of a shared dynamic system (``dynamic causation''). We use Convergent Cross Mapping (CCM), a method specifically designed to measure dynamic causation, to study the effects of varying temporal and taxonomic/functional resolution in data when constructing ecological causal networks. As the system is viewed at different scales relationships will appear and disappear. The relationship between data resolution and interaction presence is not random: the temporal scale at which a relationship is uncovered identifies a biologically relevant scale that drives changes in population abundance. Further, causal relationships between taxonomic aggregates (low-resolution) are shown to be influenced by the number of interactions between their component species (high-resolution). Because no single level of resolution captures all the causal links in a system, a more complete understanding requires multiple levels when constructing causal networks.},

  abstract = {Local food webs result from a sequence of colonisations and extinctions by species from the regional pool or metaweb, that is, the assembly process. Assembly is theorised to be a selective process: whether or not certain species or network structures can persist is partly determined by local processes including habitat filtering and dynamical constraints. Consequently, local food web structure should reflect these processes. The goal of this study was to test evidence for these selective processes by comparing the structural properties of real food webs to the expected distribution given the metaweb. We were particularly interested in ecological dynamics; if the network properties commonly associated with dynamical stability are indeed the result of stability constraints, then they should deviate from expectation in the direction predicted by theory. To create a null expectation, we used the novel approach of randomly assembling model webs by drawing species and interactions from the empirical metaweb. The assembly model permitted colonisation and extinction, and required a consumer species to have at least one prey, but had no habitat type nor population dynamical constraints. Three datasets were used: (a) the marine Antarctic metaweb, with two local food webs; (b) the 50 lakes of the Adirondacks; and (c) the arthropod community from Florida Keys' classic defaunation experiment. Contrary to our expectations, we found that there were almost no differences between empirical webs and those resulting from the null assembly model. Few empirical food webs showed significant differences with network properties, motif representations and topological roles. Network properties associated with stability did not deviate from expectation in the direction predicted by theory. Our results suggest that-for the commonly used metrics we considered-local food web structure is not strongly influenced by dynamical nor habitat restrictions. Instead, the structure is inherited from the metaweb. This suggests that the network properties typically attributed as causes or consequences of ecological stability are instead a by-product of the assembly process (i.e. spandrels), and may potentially be too coarse to detect the true signal of dynamical constraint.},

  abstract = {The study of mutualistic interaction networks has led to valuable insights into ecological and evolutionary processes. However, our understanding of network structure may depend upon the temporal scale at which we sample and analyze network data. To date, we lack a comprehensive assessment of the temporal scale-dependence of network structure across a wide range of temporal scales and geographic locations. If network structure is temporally scale-dependent, networks constructed over different temporal scales may provide very different perspectives on the structure and composition of species interactions. Furthermore, it remains unclear how various factors -- including species richness, species turnover, link rewiring and sampling effort -- act in concert to shape network structure across different temporal scales. To address these issues, we used a large database of temporally-resolved plant--pollinator networks to investigate how temporal aggregation from the scale of one day to multiple years influences network structure. In addition, we used structural equation modeling to explore the direct and indirect effects of temporal scale, species richness, species turnover, link rewiring and sampling effort on network structural properties. We find that plant--pollinator network structure is strongly temporally-scale dependent. This general pattern arises because the temporal scale determines the degree to which temporal dynamics (i.e. phenological turnover of species and links) are included in the network, in addition to how much sampling effort is put into constructing the network. Ultimately, the temporal scale-dependence of our plant--pollinator networks appears to be mostly driven by species richness, which increases with sampling effort, and species turnover, which increases with temporal extent. In other words, after accounting for variation in species richness, network structure is increasingly shaped by its underlying temporal dynamics. Our results suggest that considering multiple temporal scales may be necessary to fully appreciate the causes and consequences of interaction network structure.},

  abstract = {Food webs provide quantitative insights into the structure and dynamics of ecological communities. Previous work has shown their utility in understanding community responses to modern and ancient perturbations, including anthropogenic change and mass extinctions. However, few ancient food webs have been reconstructed due to difficulties assessing trophic interactions amongst extinct species derived from an incomplete fossil record. We present and assess the Paleo Food web Inference Model (PFIM). PFIM uses functional trait data--predictive of interactions in modern ecosystems and commonly available for fossil organisms--to reconstruct ancient food webs. We test the model by (i) applying it to four modern ecosystems with empirical constrained food webs to directly compare PFIM-constructed networks to their empirical counterparts, (ii) by carefully comparing discrepancies between PFIM-inferred and empirical webs in one of those systems, and (iii) by comparing networks describing feasible trophic interactions ("feasible webs") with networks to which we superimpose characteristic interaction distributions derived from modern theory ("realized webs"). As a proof of concept, we then apply the method to faunal data from two Cambrian fossil deposits to reconstruct ancient trophic systems. PFIM-inferred feasible food webs successfully predict {\textasciitilde}70\% of trophic interactions across four modern systems. Furthermore, inferred food webs with enforced interaction distributions (i.e., realized webs) accurately predict {\textasciitilde}90\% of interactions. Comparisons with a global database of trophic interactions and other food web models, suggest that under sampling of empirical webs accounts for up to 21\% of the remaining differences between PFIM and empirical food webs. Food webs can be reasonably approximated by inferring trophic interactions based upon life habit traits. This study provides the foundation to use trait-based inference models across the fossil record to examine ancient food webs and community evolution.},

The prevailing inability to falsify models has resulted in an accumulation of models but not an accumulation of confidence. Here, we introduce a new approach rooted in queueing theory, termed the covariance criteria, that establishes a rigorous test for model validity based on covariance relationships between observable quantities. These criteria set a high bar for models to pass by specifying necessary conditions that must hold regardless of unobserved factors. We demonstrate the broad applicability and discriminatory power of the covariance criteria by applying them to three long-standing challenges in ecological theory: resolving competing models of predator-prey functional responses, disentangling ecological and evolutionary dynamics in systems with rapid evolution, and detecting the often-elusive influence of higher-order species interactions. Across these diverse case studies, the covariance criteria consistently rule out inadequate models, while building strong confidence in those that provide strategically useful approximations. The covariance criteria approach is mathematically rigorous, computationally efficient, and often non-parametric, making it immediately applicable to existing data and models.},

  abstract = {Ecology Letters (2010) 13: 891--899 Abstract Food web structure plays an important role when determining robustness to cascading secondary extinctions. However, existing food web models do not take into account likely changes in trophic interactions (`rewiring') following species loss. We investigated structural dynamics in 12 empirically documented food webs by simulating primary species loss using three realistic removal criteria, and measured robustness in terms of subsequent secondary extinctions. In our model, novel trophic interactions can be established between predators and food items not previously consumed following the loss of competing predator species. By considering the increase in robustness conferred through rewiring, we identify a new category of species -- overlap species -- which promote robustness as shown by comparing simulations incorporating structural dynamics to those with static topologies. The fraction of overlap species in a food web is highly correlated with this increase in robustness; whereas species richness and connectance are uncorrelated with increased robustness. Our findings underline the importance of compensatory mechanisms that may buffer ecosystems against environmental change, and highlight the likely role of particular species that are expected to facilitate this buffering.},

They frequently arise through co-evolutionary processes, which match the traits of both partners, facilitating their interaction. Insights in these interaction mechanisms are vital to be able to manage changing ecosystems.

We show how kernel-based pairwise learning can predict bee--plant interactions based on the traits and the phylogeny of the plant and bee species. The traits and the phylogeny of the plant and bee species proved to be highly predictive. Although the traits were slightly more informative compared to the phylogeny, the best results were obtained by combining both the traits and the phylogeny in the model Notably, the model performance varied greatly depending on whether the goal was to pinpoint missing interactions in the network or to predict interactions for new bee species, new plant species, or both. This issue highlights the importance of proper stratification when fitting biological network prediction models. Our model, however, showed the capacity to generalize beyond the original dataset provided by FlorAbeilles. The model was validated by predicting potentially interacting plant species for the invasive bee species Megachile sculpturalis. Four out of the five plant species identified by the model could be validated based on literature.},

Ecosystem function in predator-prey food webs---Confronting dynamic models with empirical data. Journal of Animal Ecology, 88, https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.12892 Species' population dynamics are influenced by a variety of abiotic and biotic factors. Curtsdotter et al. (2019) used a food web model to investigate the role of predator--prey interactions in the population dynamics of the bird cherry-oat aphid Rhopalosiphum padi. Their analysis hinged on linking the observed population dynamics to a mathematical description of the multi-species system via inverse methods---an approach less utilized in ecology but that allows one to search a wide space of possible parameterizations and identify best-fit model parameters. By scrutinizing the fit of this model to observed aphid population dynamics in 10 separate barley fields, they identified fields in which predation was the key driving force; in others, they found that accurate predictions depended on the existence of an unpredictable and unidentified extrinsic driver of aphid mortality. By scrutinizing areas where the model gave poor or biologically counterintuitive fits, their study provides a path forward to better link ecological theory to ecosystem function.},

The complexity of empirical food webs, however, is leading many ecologists to focus dynamic ecosystem studies on smaller microcosm or mesocosm studies based upon community modules, which comprise three to five species and the interactions likely to have ecological relevance. We provide here a structural counterpart to community modules. We investigate food-web `motifs' which are n-species connected subgraphs found within the food web. Remarkably, we find that the over- and under-representation of three-species motifs in empirical food webs can be understood through comparison to a static food-web model, the niche model. Our result conclusively demonstrates that predation upon species with some `characteristic' niche value is the prey selection mechanism consistent with the structural properties of empirical food webs.},

We analyze from a statistical physics perspective the network structure of model food webs and of 15 community food webs from a variety of environments, including freshwater, marine, estuarine, and terrestrial environments. We perform a theoretical analysis of two recently proposed models for food webs, the niche model of R. J. Williams and N. D. Martinez and the nested-hierarchy model of M.-F. Cattin et al. We find that the two models generate distributions of numbers of prey, predators, and links that are described by the same analytical expressions. Our analytical treatment reveals that a model's capacity to reproduce empirical data is principally determined by its ability to satisfy two conditions: (1) the species' niche values form a totally ordered set and (2) each species has a specific exponentially decaying probability of preying on a given fraction of the species with lower niche values. To test this hypothesis, we generalize the cascade model of J. E. Cohen and C. M. Newman so that it satisfies condition 2 and find that the new model is able to reproduce the properties of empirical food webs, validating our hypothesis. We use our analytical predictions as a guide to the analysis of 15 of the most complete empirical food webs available. We demonstrate that the quantitative unifying patterns that describe the properties of the food-web models considered earlier also describe the majority of the empirical webs considered. We find good agreement between the empirical data and the models for the average distance between species and the average clustering coefficient. Our results strongly support two hypotheses: first, that any model satisfying the two conditions we identify will accurately reproduce a number of the statistical properties of empirical food webs, and second, that the empirical distributions of number of prey and number of predators follow universal functional forms that, without free parameters, match our analytical predictions.},

This finding validates a critical assumption in the recently proposed static niche model and provides guidance for ongoing efforts to develop dynamic models of ecosystems.},

For this reason, large parts of the world have a data deficit when it comes to species interactions and how the resulting networks are structured. As data collection alone is unlikely to be sufficient, community ecologists must adopt predictive methods. We present a methodological framework that uses graph embedding and transfer learning to assemble a predicted list of trophic interactions of a species pool for which their interactions are unknown. Specifically, we `learn' the information (latent traits) of species from a known interaction network and infer the latent traits of another species pool for which we have no a priori interaction data based on their phylogenetic relatedness to species from the known network. The latent traits can then be used to predict interactions and construct an interaction network. Here we assembled a metaweb for Canadian mammals derived from interactions in the European food web, despite only 4\% of common species being shared between the two locations. The results of the predictive model are compared against databases of recorded pairwise interactions, showing that we correctly recover 91\% of known interactions. The framework itself is robust even when the known network is incomplete or contains spurious interactions making it an ideal candidate as a tool for filling gaps when it comes to species interactions. We provide guidance on how this framework can be adapted by substituting some approaches or predictors in order to make it more generally applicable.},

One way to improve our ability to predict metawebs is to maximize available information by using graph embeddings, as opposed to an exhaustive list of species interactions. Graph embedding is an emerging field in machine learning that holds great potential for ecological problems. Here, we outline how the challenges associated with inferring metawebs line-up with the advantages of graph embeddings; followed by a discussion as to how the choice of the species pool has consequences on the reconstructed network, specifically as to the role of human-made (or arbitrarily assigned) boundaries and how these may influence ecological hypotheses.},

Interactions intrinsically vary across space and time, and given the number of species that compose ecological communities, it can be tough to distinguish between a true negative (where two species never interact) from a false negative (where two species have not been observed interacting even though they actually do). Assessing the likelihood of interactions between species is an imperative for several fields of ecology. This means that to predict interactions between species---and to describe the structure, variation, and change of the ecological networks they form---we need to rely on modelling tools. Here, we provide a proof-of-concept, where we show how a simple neural network model makes accurate predictions about species interactions given limited data. We then assess the challenges and opportunities associated with improving interaction predictions, and provide a conceptual roadmap forward towards predictive models of ecological networks that is explicitly spatial and temporal. We conclude with a brief primer on the relevant methods and tools needed to start building these models, which we hope will guide this research programme forward.

These definitions ignore the notion of 'physical complexity', which can measure the amount of information contained in an ecological network, and how difficult it would be to compress. We present relative rank deficiency and SVD entropy as measures of 'external' and 'internal' complexity respectively. Using bipartite ecological networks, we find that they all show a very high, almost maximal, physical complexity. Pollination networks, in particular, are more complex when compared to other types of interactions. In addition, we find that SVD entropy relates to other structural measures of complexity (nestedness, connectance, and spectral radius), but does not inform about the resilience of a network when using simulated extinction cascades, which has previously been reported for structural measures of complexity. We argue that SVD entropy provides a fundamentally more 'correct' measure of network complexity and should be added to the toolkit of descriptors of ecological networks moving forward.},

While some researchers claim that biotic interactions need to be observed directly, others use proxies and statistical approaches to infer them. Despite this ambiguity, studying and predicting the influence of biotic interactions on biogeographic patterns is a thriving area of research with crucial implications for conservation. Three distinct approaches are currently being explored. The first approach involves empirical observation and measurement of biotic interactions' effects on species demography in laboratory or field settings. While these findings contribute to theory and to understanding species' demographies, they can be challenging to generalise on a larger scale. The second approach centers on inferring biotic associations from observed co-occurrences in space and time. The goal is to distinguish the environmental and biotic effects on species distributions. The third approach constructs extensive potential interaction networks, known as metanetworks, by leveraging existing knowledge about species ecology and interactions. This approach analyses local realisations of these networks using occurrence data and allows understanding large distributions of multi-taxa assemblages. In this piece, we appraise these three approaches, highlighting their respective strengths and limitations. Instead of seeing them as conflicting, we advocate for their integration to enhance our understanding and expand applications in the emerging field of interaction biogeography. This integration shows promise for ecosystem understanding and management in the Anthropocene era.},

We argue that there are three distinct goals for statistical modeling in ecology: data exploration, inference, and prediction. Once the modeling goal is clearly articulated, an appropriate model selection procedure is easier to identify. We review model selection approaches and highlight their strengths and weaknesses relative to each of the three modeling goals. We then present examples of modeling for exploration, inference, and prediction using a time series of butterfly population counts. These show how a model selection approach flows naturally from the modeling goal, leading to different models selected for different purposes, even with exactly the same data set. This review illustrates best practices for ecologists and should serve as a reminder that statistical recipes cannot substitute for critical thinking or for the use of independent data to test hypotheses and validate predictions.},

Yet inferring reliable phylogenetic trees for thousands of species involves numerous trade-offs that have limited their utility to comparative biologists. To establish a robust evolutionary timescale for all approximately 6,000 living species of mammals, we developed credible sets of trees that capture root-to-tip uncertainty in topology and divergence times. Our ``backbone-and-patch'' approach to tree building applies a newly assembled 31-gene supermatrix to two levels of Bayesian inference: (1) backbone relationships and ages among major lineages, using fossil node or tip dating, and (2) species-level ``patch'' phylogenies with nonoverlapping in-groups that each correspond to one representative lineage in the backbone. Species unsampled for DNA are either excluded (``DNA-only'' trees) or imputed within taxonomic constraints using branch lengths drawn from local birth--death models (``completed'' trees). Joining time-scaled patches to backbones results in species-level trees of extant Mammalia with all branches estimated under the same modeling framework, thereby facilitating rate comparisons among lineages as disparate as marsupials and placentals. We compare our phylogenetic trees to previous estimates of mammal-wide phylogeny and divergence times, finding that (1) node ages are broadly concordant among studies, and (2) recent (tip-level) rates of speciation are estimated more accurately in our study than in previous ``supertree'' approaches, in which unresolved nodes led to branch-length artifacts.

  abstract = {Trophic interactions are often deduced from body size differences, assuming that predators prefer prey smaller than themselves because larger prey are more difficult to subdue. This has mainly been confirmed in aquatic ecosystems, but rarely in terrestrial ecosystems, especially in arthropods. Our goal was to validate whether body size ratios can predict trophic interactions in a terrestrial, plant-associated arthropod community and whether predator hunting strategy and prey taxonomy could explain additional variation. We conducted feeding trials with arthropods from marram grass in coastal dunes to test whether two individuals, of the same or different species, would predate each other. From the trial results, we constructed one of the most complete, empirically derived food webs for terrestrial arthropods associated with a single plant species. We contrasted this empirical food web with a theoretical web based on body size ratios, activity period, microhabitat, and expert knowledge. In our feeding trials, predator--prey interactions were indeed largely size-based. Moreover, the theoretical and empirically based food webs converged well for both predator and prey species. However, predator hunting strategy, and especially prey taxonomy improved predictions of predation. Well-defended taxa, such as hard-bodied beetles, were less frequently consumed than expected based on their body size. For instance, a beetle of average size (measuring 4 mm) is 38\% less vulnerable than another average arthropod with the same length. Body size ratios predict trophic interactions among plant-associated arthropods fairly well. However, traits such as hunting strategy and anti-predator defences can explain why certain trophic interactions do not adhere to size-based rules. Feeding trials can generate insights into multiple traits underlying real-life trophic interactions among arthropods.},

This review shows that researchers of plant--animal mutualisms have made substantial progress in the understanding of the processes behind the patterns observed in mutualistic networks. At the same time, we are still far from a thorough, integrative mechanistic understanding. We close with specific suggestions for directions of future research, which include developing methods to evaluate the relative importance of mechanisms influencing network patterns and focusing research efforts on selected representative study systems throughout the world.},

  abstract = {Ecological network models based on aggregated data from species interactions are widely used to make inferences about species specialization, functionality and extinction risk. While increasing number of network data are available and are used in comparative studies, data quality and uncertainty have received little attention. Moreover, key individual-level information such as the proportion of individuals not involved in interactions and underlying processes driving interactions are ignored by aggregated data analysis. We suggest an individual-level hierarchical interaction model as a more flexible approach to considering uncertainty, sampling effort and conditions under which interactions take place and from which network attributes can be derived. We performed a simulation exercise to compare inference under different sample sizes and from aggregated data matrices to those from our individual-level model. Formalizing the process of network formation in an individual-level model made clear that per-species interaction frequencies are not independent of sample size and population pools and also ignore important information given by the proportion of non-interacting individuals. Hierarchical linear models are a possible solution to infer community-level attributes of network formation and allow various kinds of comprehensive model extensions to capture variation of per-individual interactions in space and time that shape upper level organization. Individual-level hierarchical models provide the link between individual behaviour and interactions under variable environmental conditions and can be summarized into networks in a conceptually neat way. Such models may not only help to account for various sources of variation but also conceptualize aspects overlooked in aggregated data. In particular, the quantification of per-individual interactions under different sampling scenarios emphasizes that per-species interaction frequencies at the species level are not necessarily a surrogate of species abundance in natural systems under investigation.},

The relationship between abundance and body size has been extensively studied in an attempt to quantify the form of the relationship and to understand the processes that generate it. However, progress has been impeded by the underappreciated fact that there are four distinct, but interrelated, relationships between size and abundance that are often confused in the literature. Here, we review and distinguish between these four patterns, and discuss the linkages between them. We argue that a synthetic understanding of size--abundance relationships will result from more detailed analyses of individual patterns and from careful consideration of how and why the patterns are related.},

In the niche model, each species has three traits, niche position, diet position and feeding range. Here, a new probabilistic niche model, which allows the maximum likelihood set of trait values to be estimated for each species, is applied to the food web of the Benguela fishery. We also developed the allometric niche model, in which body size is used as the niche dimension. About 80\% of the links in the empirical data are predicted by the probabilistic niche model, a significant improvement over recent models. As in the niche model, species are uniformly distributed on the niche axis. Feeding ranges are exponentially distributed, but diet positions are not uniformly distributed below the predator. Species traits are strongly correlated with body size, but the allometric niche model performs significantly worse than the probabilistic niche model. The best-fit parameter set provides a significantly better model of the structure of the Benguela food web than was previously available. The methodology allows the identification of a number of taxa that stand out as outliers either in the model's poor performance at predicting their predators or prey or in their parameter values. While important, body size alone does not explain the structure of the one-dimensional niche.},

Early mechanism-based theory asserted that food webs have little omnivory and several properties that are independent of species richness1,2,3,4,6. This theory was overturned by empirical studies that found food webs to be much more complex5,7,8,9,14,15,16,17,18, but these studies did not provide mechanistic explanations for the complexity9. Here we show that a remarkably simple model fills this scientific void by successfully predicting key structural properties of the most complex and comprehensive food webs in the primary literature. These properties include the fractions of species at top, intermediate and basal trophic levels, the means and variabilities of generality, vulnerability and food-chain length, and the degrees of cannibalism, omnivory, looping and trophic similarity. Using only two empirical parameters, species number and connectance, our `niche model' extends the existing `cascade model'3,19 and improves its fit ten-fold by constraining species to consume a contiguous sequence of prey in a one-dimensional trophic niche20.},

These models predict the detailed structure of complex food webs given only two input parameters, the numbers of species and the number of feeding links among them. 2 The models claim different degrees of success but have not been compared consistently with each other or with the empirical data. We compared the performance of five structural models rigorously against 10 empirical food webs from a variety of aquatic and terrestrial habitats containing 25--92 species and 68--997 links. 3 All models include near-hierarchical ordering of species' consumption and have identical distributions of the number of prey of each consumer species, but differ in the extent to which species' diets are required to be contiguous and the rules used to assign feeding links. 4 The models perform similarly on a range of food-web properties, including the fraction of top, intermediate and basal species, the standard deviations of generality and connectivity and the fraction of herbivores and omnivores. 5 For other properties, including the standard deviation of vulnerability, the fraction of cannibals and species in loops, mean trophic level, path length, clustering coefficient, maximum similarity and diet discontinuity, there are significant differences in the performance of the different models. 6 While the empirical data do not support the niche model's assumption of diet contiguity, models which relax this assumption all have worse overall performance than the niche model. All the models under-estimate severely the fraction of species that are herbivores and exhibit other important failures that need to be addressed in future research.},

Attributes such as diet, foraging strata, foraging time, and body size, in particular, characterize a large portion of the ``Eltonian'' niches of species. Here we present a global species-level compilation of these key attributes for all 9993 and 5400 extant bird and mammal species derived from key literature sources. Global handbooks and monographs allowed the consistent sourcing of attributes for most species. For diet and foraging stratum we followed a defined protocol to translate the verbal descriptions into standardized, semiquantitative information about relative importance of different categories. Together with body size (continuous) and activity time (categorical) this enables a much finer distinction of species' foraging ecology than typical categorical guild assignments allow. Attributes lacking information for specific species are flagged, and interpolated values based on taxonomy are provided instead. The presented data set is limited by, among others, these select cases missing observed data, by errors and uncertainty in the expert assessment as presented in the literature, and by the lack of intraspecific information. However, the standardized and transparent nature and complete global coverage of the data set should support an array of potential studies in biogeography, community ecology, macroevolution, global change biology, and conservation. Potential uses include comparative work involving these traits as focal or secondary variables, ecological research on the trait or trophic structure of communities, or conservation science concerned with the loss of function among species or in ecosystems in a changing world. We hope that this publication will spur the sharing, collaborative curation, and extension of data to the benefit of a more integrative, rigorous, and global biodiversity science.},

  abstract = {Understanding and predicting the dynamics of multispecies systems generally require estimates of interaction strength among species. Measuring interaction strength is difficult because of the large number of interactions in any natural system, long-term feedback, multiple pathways of effects between species pairs, and possible nonlinearities in interaction-strength functions. Presently, the few studies that extensively estimate interaction strength suggest that distributions of interaction strength tend to be skewed toward few strong and many weak interactions. Modeling studies indicate that such skewed patterns tend to promote system stability and arise during assembly of persistent communities. Methods for estimating interaction strength efficiently from traits of organisms, such as allometric relationships, show some promise. Methods for estimating community response to environmental perturbations without an estimate of interaction strength may also be of use. Spatial and temporal scale may affect patterns of interaction strength, but these effects require further investigation and new multispecies modeling frameworks. Future progress will be aided by development of long-term multispecies time series of natural communities, by experimental tests of different methods for estimating interaction strength, and by increased understanding of nonlinear functional forms.}

  abstract = {Species traits and environmental conditions determine the occurrence and strength of trophic interactions. If we understand the relationship between these factors and trophic interactions, we can make more accurate predictions and build better trophic-interaction models. We can compare traits and conditions by considering their effect on different parts (steps) of a trophic interaction, such as the steps search and pursuit. By linking traits to relevant steps, we can use these relationships to build trophic-interaction models. Currently, this is done ad hoc, defining steps based on the species and traits of interest. This makes it difficult to compare across traits and species and gain an overarching understanding of how traits and the environment drive trophic interactions. We present a comprehensive approach for the explicit choice of interaction steps and species traits or environmental conditions, which is readily integrated into existing models. The core of this framework is that it is modular; we present eight steps that occur in all trophic interactions and use them to build a modular, general dynamic model. When applying the framework, one explicitly selects only the most relevant steps and uses those to build a specific model. To build our modular framework, we revisit and expand the functional and numerical response functions, dividing the trophic interaction into eight steps: (1) search, (2) prey detection, (3) attack decision, (4) pursuit, (5) subjugation, (6) ingestion, (7) digestion and (8) nutrient allocation. Together these steps form a general dynamical model where trophic interactions can be explicitly parameterized for multiple traits and environmental factors. We then concretize this approach by outlining how a specific community can be modelled by selecting key modules (steps) and parameterizing them for relevant factors. This we exemplify for a community of terrestrial arthropods using empirical data on body size and temperature responses. With species interactions at the core of community dynamics, our modular approach allows for quantification and comparisons of the importance of different steps, traits, and abiotic factors across ecosystems and trophic-interaction types, and provides a powerful tool for trait-based prediction of food-web structure and dynamics.

Our results demonstrate that the expert partition is surprisingly incomplete in some networks such as the famous political blogs network, indicating that the relation between meta-data and community structure in real-world networks needs to be re-examined. As a byproduct we find that the exclusive modularity, which introduces a null model based on the degree-corrected stochastic block model, is of independent interest.

Most of the parameters in these models are determined by the body sizes and metabolic categories (endotherm, vertebrate ectotherm, invertebrate ectotherm, or plant) of the populations in question. The remaining parameters have clear biological meanings. The intent of these models is to provide maximum realism from minimum data when needed because of constraints of time or of resources for empirical research. The models also demonstrate the influence of physiological power and body size on consumer-resource dynamics. For a given metabolic type, we define ecological scope as the ratio of maximal ingestion rate to respiration rate. Invertebrate ectotherms have greater ecological scope than do vertebrate ectotherms, which have greater scope than do endotherms. Greater ecological scope implies ability to subsist on scarcer resources and a tendency to more stable dynamics. Changes in dynamics associated with increased resource carrying capacity K (the "paradox of enrichment") are investigated. Robust limit cycles (sustained oscillations) require a Type III functional response, but even in this case the cycles quickly "implode" (with respect to changes in K) to extremely small densities if the resource-consumer body mass ratio is too high. Estimates are given for resource-consumer body mass ratios that permit robust limit cycles, and some pertinent data are discussed. An analytic expression for the periods of limit cycles is derived. In terms of body mass, the periods scale as (consumer body mass)1/8 (resource body mass)1/8.}

It is found that food webs from environments classifiedd by Briand as "fluctuating" differ significantly, both in number and in average size of dominant cliques, from food webs from environments classified by Briand as "constant." In addition, food web intervality (Cohen 1978) is found to be associated with poverty in dominant cliques. Adding constraints on dominant clique number to "assembled" food web models (Yodzis 1981) yields mathematical food web universes which predict the observed frequency of interval food webs.}
