\textbf{Abstract:} Food webs are a useful abstraction and representation
of the feeding links between species in a community and are used to
infer many ecosystem level processes. However, the different theories,
mechanisms, and criteria that underpin how a food web is defined, and
ultimately, constructed means that not all food webs are representing
the same ecological process at the same scale. Here we present a
synthesis of the different assumptions, scales, and mechanisms that are
used to define the different ecological networks , leading to a revision
of definitions for different types of networks. Additionally we
explicitly link the different network representations to the broader
methodological approaches (models) that are used to construct them. In
explicitly outlining the assumptions, scales, and mechanisms of network
inference allows for a formal categorisation of how to use networks to
answer key ecological and conservation questions as wel as defining
clear guidelines to prevent unintentional misuse or misinterpretation.

At the heart of modern biodiversity science are a set of concepts and
theories about species richness, stability, and function (Loreau \& de
Mazancourt, 2013). These relate to the abundance, distribution,
functions, and services that biodiversity provides. Network
representations of biodiversity are increasingly argued to be an asset
to understanding and predicting the impacts of multiple, simultaneous
stress on these core components of biodiversity (Simmons et al., 2021).
Documenting interactions between and among species is thus one of the
fundamental building blocks of community ecology and provide a powerful
abstraction and platform for mathematical and statistical modelling of
biodiversity to make predictions, and to mitigate and manage threats
(Windsor et al., 2023).

However, there is a growing discourse around limitations to the
interpretation and applied use of networks (Blüthgen, 2010; Dormann,
2023). Against this, it is important to evaluate the value and the
limitations of the various network conceptualisations of biodiversity
(Blüthgen \& Staab, 2024). In this perspective we aim to provide an
overview of different \textbf{food web} representations, particularly
how each representation embeds assumptions about the processes that
determine interactions (Section~\ref{sec-process}) about the levels of
organization at which this occurs (\emph{i.e.} the biological,
ecological, spatial/temporal scale) and and the way in which we
construct the resulting networks (Section~\ref{sec-construct}). The
differences among this tri-partite set of assumptions ultimately
influence the nature and scope of inference that can be made from a
given network (Proulx et al., 2005).

Fundamentally, we are talking about an intersection of the type of data
used to construct a network and the underlying theory as to what drives
the resolution and occurrence of interactions between species in those
data. We still lack a clear explanation of the different assumptions and
scale dependent processes that underpin network construction alongside
extensive discussions about the challenges relating to data collection
and observation (\emph{e.g.,} Blüthgen \& Staab, 2024; Brimacombe et
al., 2023, 2024; Moulatlet et al., 2024; Polis, 1991; Pringle \&
Hutchinson, 2020; Saberski et al., 2024). Such an understanding should
deliver an acceleration in capacity to more effectively predict the
impact of multiple stressors on biodiverse communities.

In their recent work, Gauzens et al. (2025) showcased a 2+2
decomposition of networks around aggregated versus species level
resolution of nodes and around potential and realised links among the
nodes. Their review delivers valuable insight into the methodologies
used to collect and manage data among the node and link differentiation.
It also delivers an overview of the scale and types of questions that
are associated with each category of differentiation.

Here we provide a complementary perspective focused on concepts, models,
and theory, in contrast to the data driven breakdown in Gauzens et al.
(2025) (e.g.~their Tables 1 and 2). Our approach delivers a hierarchical
perspective on network construction based on a gradient from
feasibility, capturing the concept of metawebs and Gauzen et al's
`potential' webs, through to realised webs as in Gauzens' et al.~In
contrast to their 2 + 2 decomposition (their Fig 1), our perspective
showcases nested ecological scales and processes that derive from shifts
in the assumptions and theories embedded along this gradient. This
includes classic ecological `aggregations' such as
functional/phylogenetic groups through to species, populations and
individuals, unique perspective on how space and time intersect with
node and link resolution, refined insight into which networks are
derived by induction vs.~deduction and a revealing of a core transition
between assumptions about how links are derived based on evolutionary
vs.~ecological theories.

In the following sections we provide a scene-setting review of nodes and
edges (links) in networks before aligning various processes that
determine interactions with the different network representations.
Ultimately, we provide a unique perspective on the nested hierarchy of
processes that govern transitions from meta-webs to realised webs. We
finish with a refined and nuanced alignment of models/representations
and key questions in biodiveristy science in the anthropocene.

\section{Setting the Scene: The Not So Basics of Nodes and
Edges}\label{sec-anatomy}

Networks in ecology have multiple uses, representing an `object' from
which inferences can be made. For example, a network is needed to make
inference specifically about the structure of communities. The structure
of networks - their topology - have a long history reflecting core
theory about energy flow (Lindeman, 1942), function (Schneider et al.,
2016) and even stability (Brose et al., 2006; Danet et al., 2024).
Networks are thus required as the response variable in evaluating
ecological theory and statistical models of `generative processes'
giving rise to such structure. Such structure is now commonly used to
compare communities along environmental gradients or time (Hao et al.,
2025; Pecuchet et al., 2020). Networks and their topology are also used
as a platform for evaluating `downstream' responses to stressors such as
evaluating patterns of secondary extinction (Keyes et al., 2024;
Staniczenko et al., 2010). Finally, they are commonly used as a platform
for implementing mathematical models of community dynamics (\emph{e.g.,}
Delmas et al., 2017); delivering inference about stability, function,
invasive species, climate change, contaminants, and secondary extinction
(\emph{e.g.,} Curtsdotter et al., 2019), to name a few applications.
Against this backdrop of multiple research agendas, the definition of
`edges' and `nodes', and the levels of organisation at which they are
defined, take many forms (Moulatlet et al., 2024; Poisot, Stouffer, et
al., 2016), each of which encode a series of assumptions within a
network. Here we introduce a perspective on these baseline assumptions.

\subsection{How do we define a node?}\label{how-do-we-define-a-node}

Although this may seem elementary that a node should represent a
(taxonomic) species, the reality is that nodes often represents
non-taxonomic units such as a trophic species (\emph{e.g.,} Yodzis
(1982); Williams \& Martinez (2000)), a feeding guild (\emph{e.g.,}
García-Callejas et al., 2023), or a segregation of species by life
stages (\emph{e.g.,} Clegg et al., 2018). Such granularity and variation
is often defined as aggregation. Such aggregation can limit the ability
to make species (taxonomic) specific inferences (\emph{e.g.,} does
species \(a\) eat species \(b\)?). It can also affect the estimates of
degree distributions and more specifically generality and vulnerability
in networks (in/out degree). These metrics are central to inference
about the structure and complexity of networks(Beckerman et al., 2006;
Clegg et al., 2018). Finally, aggregation makes it challenging to use
networks in `downstream analyses' of, for example, extinction or
invasions as the identity of species and the consequences of their
losses can be hidden. Despite these issues, there are justifications for
representing nodes as aggregated units. Most prominent relates to when
the distribution of the links between aggregated nodes may be more
meaningful in terms of understanding or making generalisations about the
system *e.g.,* tracking species extinctions across feeding guilds
(Dunhill et al., 2024).

\subsection{What is captured by an edge?}\label{sec-edge}

In order to break down the definitions of an edge, it is important to
introduce the concept of \emph{potential} versus \emph{realised} links:
potential links reflect feasibility while realised links are connected
to flux of some currency (typically energy; see below for more detail).
Links within food webs are thus a representation of either potential
links between species Pringle (2020) or fluxes within a system
\emph{e.g.,} energy transfer or material flow as the result of the
feeding links between species (Lindeman, 1942; Proulx et al., 2005).
Edges can thus correspond to different `currencies' (Gauzens et al.,
2025). There is also a myriad of ways in which the links themselves can
be specified. Links between species can be treated as present or absent
(\emph{i.e.,} binary), may be defined as probabilities (Banville et al.,
2025; Poisot, Cirtwill, et al., 2016) or by continuous functions which
further quantify the strength of an interaction (Berlow et al., 2004).
How links are specified thus requires intersecting both the currency
being modelled and their specification. For example, feasibility is
unlikely to accommodate flux, but does align with binary or probability
representations. Taking a food web that consists of links representing
feasible interactions among a collection of species will be meaningless
if one is interested in understanding the flow of energy through the
network as the links are not environmentally/energetically constrained.

\subsection{Network representations}\label{sec-representation}

Against these definitions of nodes and edges, networks fall into two
major `types': metawebs, traditionally defined as all the
\emph{potential} interactions for a specific species pool (Dunne, 2006);
and realised networks, which is the subset of interactions in a metaweb
that are \emph{realised} for a specific community at a given time and
place. The fundamental differences between these two network
representations are the spatial and temporal scale at which they are
constructed, and the associated processes that are assumed to drive
pattern at these scales.

A metaweb is, at its core, a list of \emph{feasible} interactions
between pairs of species. The feasibility for a given pair is derived
from the complementarity of their traits, typically aligned with
feeding. Feasibility can be further refined by \emph{co-occurrence}
leading to the transition from a \emph{global} to \emph{regional
metaweb}. Metawebs thus provide a means to identify evolutionarily
plausible links, regionally plausible interactions, the set of
ecologically impossible, \emph{i.e.,} forbidden, links (Jordano, 2016b),
and ultimately a definition of the plausible \emph{complete} diet of a
species (Strydom et al., 2023).

In contrast, realised networks are typically more localised in space and
time, and the links between species are contingent on the co-occurrence
of species, the role of the environment, and mechanisms of diet choice.
Fundamentally this means that the presence/absence of a link is the
result of the `behaviour' of the species and even when the realised
network is presented as a binary matrix, the edges imply a function is
available to define the strength of an interaction. A realised network
is therefore not simply the downscaling of a metaweb to a smaller scale
(\emph{e.g.,} moving from the country to the 1x1 km\textsuperscript{2}
scale based on fine-scale species co-occurrence). Instead, realised webs
capture processes that determine the realisation of an interaction and
flows of energy in a community. Specifically, in realised webs, the
definition of an edge shifts from being determined by feasibility to
that of choices and consequences that centre around energy. If one were
to take the same community of species and construct both a metaweb and
realised network the two networks might have the same species but would
be structurally different, owing to the differences in the `rules'
constraining the presence of links. This distinction between metawebs
and realised webs leads to a further insight. Links that are absent in a
metaweb can conceptually (although not always practically) be treated as
being truly absent. However, links that are absent in a realised network
cannot be considered as truly absent but rather as absent due to the
broader environmental/community context.

\section{From Nodes and Edges to Process and
Constraints}\label{sec-process}

In the previous section we discussed how the definition of nodes and
edges, representing different scales and processes, lead to the concept
of a metaweb and a realised web. The fundamental take-homes are that
nodes vary in their resolution, edges vary in what kind of process they
represent and the intersection of these, defined by meta- vs.~realised
webs, underpins distinct lines of inquiry and constraints on the type of
inference we can make with networks. Here we reveal five core
constraints across evolutionary and ecological scales that further
delineate the transition from meta- to realised webs, exposing processes
that determine the nature of links among nodes: evolutionary
compatibility, co-occurrence, abundance, diet choice, and non-trophic
interactions Figure~\ref{fig-process}.

\caption{\label{fig-process}Aligning the various processes that
determine interactions (right column) with the different network
representations (left column). First, we start with a \textbf{global
metaweb} this network captures all possible interactions for a
collection of species in the global context. However, within the global
environment different species occur in different regions (region one =
yellow and region 2 = orange), and it is possible to construct two
different metawebs (\textbf{regional metawebs}) for each region by
taking accounting for the co-occurrence of the difference species - as
shown here we have two regions with some species that are found in both
regions (blue) and others endemic to either region one (yellow) or
region two (orange). However even within a region we do not expect all
interactions to be realised but rather that there are multiple
configurations of the regional metaweb over both space and time. The
`state' of the different \textbf{realised networks} is ultimately
influenced not just by the co-occurrence of a species pair but rather
the larger community context such as the abundance of different species,
maximisation of energy gain, or indirect/higher order interactions.}

\end{figure}%

\subsection{Processes that determine the feasibility of an
interaction}\label{sec-process-feasibility}

Evolutionary compatibility and co-occurrence are the two principle
processes that `act' at the species pair of interest and define
feasibility. The scale of inference and set of processes embodied in
these two constraints typically combine to define a `list' of
interactions that are viable/feasible and defined strictly as
present/absent. Reflecting on the previous section, nodes are typically
species and rules defining edges are defined by trait complementarity
(phylogenetic) and/or co-occurrence. Here we provide more insight into
each process.

\textbf{Evolutionary compatibility}

This constraint is defined by shared (co)evolutionary history between
consumers and resources (Dalla Riva \& Stouffer, 2016; Gómez et al.,
2010; Rossberg et al., 2006; Segar et al., 2020) which is manifested as
`trait complementarity' between two species (Benadi et al., 2022). In
this body of theory, the consumer has the `correct' set of traits that
allow it to chase, capture, and consume the resource. Interactions that
are not compatible are defined as forbidden links (Jordano, 2016b);
\emph{i.e.,} they are not physically possible and will \emph{always} be
absent within a network.

Networks do not properly arise from models based on this constraint.
Instead, interacting species pairs are defined and these are represented
as binary (possible vs forbidden) or probabilistic (Banville et al.,
2025). For example, in the metaweb constructed by Strydom et al. (2022)
probabilities are quantified as the confidence of a specific interaction
being \emph{possible} between two species. A network constructed on the
basis of evolutionary compatibility is conceptually aligned with a
`global metaweb', and gives us information as to the global feasibility
of links between species pairs despite the fact that they do not
co-occur (see Figure~\ref{fig-process}).

\textbf{(Co)occurrence}

The co-occurrence of species in both time and space is a fundamental
requirement for an interaction between two species to occur (at least in
terms of feeding links). Although co-occurrence data alone is
insufficient for building an accurate and ecologically meaningful
representation of \emph{feeding links} (Blanchet et al., 2020), it is
still a critical process that determines the realisation of a feeding.
Knowledge on the co-occurrence of species allows us to spatially
constrain a global metaweb to reflect regional metawebs (Dansereau,
Barros, et al., 2024). In the context of Figure~\ref{fig-process} this
would be the metawebs for regions one and two.

We reinforce that these two constraints don't deliver a network
\emph{per se,} but a list of feasible species pairs. Although it is
possible to build a network from the list of interactions generated by
these constraints, it is important to be aware that the structure of
this network is not constrained by any community context: just because
species are able to interact does not mean that they will (Caron et al.,
2024; Poisot et al., 2015).

\subsection{Processes that realise
networks}\label{sec-process-realisation}

In contrast to the above, here we highlight three processes that
influence the \emph{realisation} of an interaction between species and
thus form the conceptual basis for realised networks. As we show in
Figure~\ref{fig-process}, a `truly realised' network is the product of
properties of the community (\textbf{abundance} and \textbf{non-trophic
interactions}) and the individual (\textbf{diet choice}). This
represents a conceptual shift from considering the feasibility for
species pairwise interactions to considering the edge as a
representation of energy flow. Such a transition requires information
about how the community, the environment and the individual
\emph{constrains} network topology as defined by consumer choice
(Quintero et al. (2024), Section~\ref{sec-representation})

\textbf{Abundance}

Abundance as a realising process emerges from a null model for energy
acquisition: organisms feeding randomly will consume resources in
proportion to their abundance (Stephens \& Krebs, 1986). Here, abundance
of different prey species influences the distribution of links in a
network (Vázquez et al., 2009) by defining a preference linked to
individuals among species meeting (Banville et al., 2025; Poisot et al.,
2015). Abundance data, linked to a derived metaweb delivers a foundation
ruleset that can define the distribution and strength of links. Of note,
however, is that such abundance constrained interactions are not
necessarily contingent on there being any compatibility between species
(E. Canard et al., 2012; Momal et al., 2020; Pomeranz et al., 2019).

\textbf{Diet choice}

It is well established that consumers make more active decisions than
eating items in proportion to their abundance (Stephens \& Krebs, 1986).
Ultimately, consumer choice is underpinned by an energetic cost-benefit
framework centered around profitability and defined by traits associated
with finding, catching, killing, and consuming a resource (Smith et al.,
2021; Wootton et al., 2023). Energetic constraints are invoked to
construct networks in a myriad of ways (\emph{e.g.,} Beckerman et al.,
2006; Cherif et al., 2024; Pawar et al., 2012; Portalier et al., 2019).

In contrast to metaweb `construction' from a list of pairwise
interactions, these methods deliver a realised web directly and as an
emergent property of node behaviour. We also here make a distinction,
developed below, with models like the Niche Model, where diet choice is
implicit in it's probabilistic network generating function, but it is
working to replicate the \emph{expected} structure of the network and
this structure does not emerge from node-based rules. Note that we
select diet choice as a term to capture rules linked to optimal foraging
(Pyke, 1984) and metabolic theory (Brown et al., 2004); it is a sensible
`umbrella concept' for capturing the energetic constraint on of the
distribution and strength of interactions.

\textbf{Non-trophic interactions}

We include non-trophic interactions (see Miele et al., 2019) here not as
a determinant of links, but a modifier of them - they are the community
context above and beyond co-occurrence and abundance. Non-trophic
interactions include competition for space, predator interference,
refuge provisioning, recruitment facilitation as well as non-trophic
effects that increase or decrease mortality. These interactions (Ings et
al., 2009) specifically modify either the realisation or strength of
trophic interactions (Golubski \& Abrams, 2011; Kamaru et al., 2024;
Pilosof et al., 2017; Staniczenko et al., 2010) and represent direct
(e.g., predator \(a\) outcompetes predator \(b\)) and indirect (e.g.,
mutualistic/facilitative interactions) mechanisms. They operate on the
realisation of a network by altering the fine-scale distribution and
abundance of species and relative contributions of direct and indirect
effects to biomass, persistence, stability and the functioning of the
communities (Buche et al., 2024; Kéfi et al., 2012, 2015; Miele et al.,
2019).

\section{Network construction}\label{sec-construct}

The above five processes are central to understanding the assumptions
inherent in building different types of networks. Each of the processes,
or combinations thereof, deliver a unique set of boundary conditions on
what a network represents and can be used for. Here we build on the
introduction of these five processes to further categorise the
approaches to constructing networks. In doing so also introduce more
detail on a variety of methodologies used to construct networks.

\subsection{Why construct networks?}\label{why-construct-networks}

Networks are a representation of biodiversity. In a perfect world, we
might know about all interactions. However, the empirical collection of
interaction data is both costly and challenging to execute (Jordano,
2016a, 2016b; Poisot et al., 2021). In the absence of robust empirical
data, we construct models that facilitate interpolation and gap-filling
of existing empirical datasets (\emph{e.g.,} Biton et al., 2024; Dallas
et al., 2017; Poisot et al., 2023; Stock et al., 2017), predict the
feasibility of interaction among pairs of species, or directly predict
network structure (see Strydom et al., 2021 for a broader discussion).

They are unique in delivering more than just estimates of species
richness. As noted in the introduction, a network embodies the
organising structure of biodiversity and allows numerous opportunities
for `downstream' analysis, including the comparison of structures,
estimation of energy flux or extinction dynamics and ultimately form the
structural inputs to dynamical systems models that facilitate ecological
and conservation relevant inference about
productivity-diversity-stability-function relationships (Danet et al.,
2024) in space and time. But making such inferences requires careful
attention to one or more of the processes discussed in
Section~\ref{sec-process}.

\subsection{Construction through induction}\label{sec-construct-induct}

Constructing feasible or realised networks can be framed as an
`inductive reasoning' process where insight and generalisation arises
from a set of observations and relationships. Inductive reasoning as a
foundation for network construction is implemented through node- and
network levels. When applied at the node level, species specific
networks are created and judge by their association with expected
feeding interactions. When applied at the network level, networks are
judged by their structural properties \emph{per se}.

\subsubsection{Species specific networks: construction through node
level
induction}\label{species-specific-networks-construction-through-node-level-induction}

Constructing feasible networks and facilitating the interpolation or
gap-filling of existing empirical datasets on sets of species
interactions can be framed as an `inductive reasoning' process where
insight and generalisation arises from a set of observations and
relationships about feeding. All methods in this inference space rest on
a set of three assumptions: there are a set of `feeding rules' that
underpin interaction feasibility (Morales-Castilla et al., 2015); these
rules are phylogenetically conserved (Bramon Mora et al., 2018; Dalla
Riva \& Stouffer, 2016); and they can be specified by matching the
traits between consumer and resource.

Evolutionary compatibility and co-occurrence constraints, the foundation
theory for feasible networks, have been critical to the construction of
`first draft' networks for communities for which we have no interaction
data (Strydom et al., 2022). They are also central to interpolation in
data poor regions and predicting interactions for `unobservable'
communities \emph{e.g.,} prehistoric networks (Dunhill et al., 2024;
Fricke et al., 2022; Yeakel et al., 2014) or future, novel community
assemblages (Van der Putten et al., 2010). Furthermore, they have the
capacity to evaluate a role of interactions among species relative to
their distribution by accounting for the role of the environment and the
role of species interactions (Gravel et al., 2019; Higino et al., 2023;
Pollock et al., 2014).There are substantial data requirements for these
approaches including expert knowledge, species traits and phylogenetic
relationships and/or interaction data on related species or communities.

Feeding rules are defined in multiple ways. The determination of the
feeding rules can be defined \emph{a priori} based expert knowledge
opinions. Typically this is done on a `trait matching' basis. An example
are the paleo food web models of Shaw et al. (2024) and Roopnarine
(2017) that specify a series of rules for a set of traits and
interactions are deemed feasible if all conditions are met.
Alternatively the body size ratio between the consumer and resource is
often used (\emph{e.g.,} Gravel et al., 2013; Rohr et al., 2010), with
the idea that consumers will only utilise a resource with a body size is
less than or equal to their own. However, work from Van De Walle et al.
(2023) seems to suggest that adding morphological traits in addition to
body size ratio improves model performance.

Rules are also defined by correlating real world interaction data with
suitable ecological proxies for which data is more widely available
(\emph{e.g.,} traits) using some sort of binary classifier (see Pichler
et al. (2020) for an overview). These include generalised linear models
(\emph{e.g.,} Caron et al., 2022), random forest (\emph{e.g.,} Llewelyn
et al., 2023), trait-based k-NN (\emph{e.g.,} Desjardins-Proulx et al.,
2017), and Bayesian models (Cirtwill et al., 2019; \emph{e.g.,} Eklöf et
al., 2013).

Finally, graph embedding uses the structural features of a known network
to infer the position of species in an unknown network through the
decomposition of the interaction onto the embedding space. This
decomposition relies on a combination of ecological proxies
(\emph{e.g.,} traits) in conjunction with known interactions to infer
the latent values of species, which can then be mapped onto
decomposition of a known network. See Strydom et al. (2023) for a
detailed review of methods and Strydom et al. (2022) for a specific
example.

\subsubsection{Species agnostic networks: construction through structure
induction}\label{species-agnostic-networks-construction-through-structure-induction}

Networks in this category are generated rules that create non-random
networks that reflect empirical knowledge of ecological network
structures and evaluated by matching predictions to this \emph{expected}
structure of the network(s). The determination of links between species
is only implicitly linked to properties of the nodes. This means these
networks are usually not species specific. Although these models are
data input light, often requiring only species richness and an estimate
of the number of expected links, they make clear assumptions regarding
what the expectations are for network structure. These are some of the
most commonly used network generation tools (e.g.~the Niche model;
Williams \& Martinez (2008)). There are two sub-categories of these
species agnostic networks.

Stochastic network models use a probabilistic rule-set about diet choice
and niche breadth to reflect fundamental ideas of foraging biology.
These models that are based on the compartmentalisation and acquisition
of energy for species at different trophic levels (Allesina \& Pascual,
2009; Krause et al., 2003) and that network structure can be determined
by distributing interactions along single dimension {[}the `niche axis';
Allesina et al. (2008){]}. Typically these models parametrise some
aspect of the network structure (although see Allesina \& Pascual, 2009
for a parameter-free model). These models include the most commonly used
network generator, the Niche model (Williams \& Martinez, 2000), as well
as the original Cascade model (Cohen et al., 1990) and the derived
Nested hierarchy model (Cattin et al., 2004). These models often form
the basis for dynamic models \emph{e.g.,} the allometric trophic network
(Brose et al., 2006; Schneider et al., 2016) and bioenergetic food web
models (Delmas et al., 2017).

\subsection{Construction through
deduction}\label{construction-through-deduction}

In contrast to the above approaches centered on feasibility, realised
networks via methods reflecting abundance and diet choice typically rely
on deductive reasoning and have a unique agenda to those above. In
contrast to the inductive methods, inference about a realised network
follows from a set of premises defining generative processes, often
referred to as mechanisms. Typically, models that embed abundance and
diet choice constraints reference theory that allows inference about the
distribution and strength of interactions. Such models are `network
topology generators' and have a strong representation in research
comparing network structures along environmental gradients and
delivering inference about extinctions and energy flux. They also
provide the structural backbone for dynamical systems modelling to
address questions about stability-structure-productivity-function
relationships, secondary extinction dynamics, species invasion and
climate change. There are two broad group of models in this deductive
category.

\subsubsection{Species-specific
networks}\label{species-specific-networks}

These models capture the behaviour of the nodes by explicitly taking
into account the properties of the different species in the community.
Which means that there is a degree of variance in which links are
predicted between species unlike the more `static' predictions made by
inductive models. However, these networks are `costly' to construct in
real world settings (requiring data about the entire community, as it is
the behaviour of the system that determines the behaviour of the part)
and also lack the larger diet niche context afforded by metawebs.

Neutral networks are built on the assumption that foraging decisions are
tied \emph{only} to the abundance of species within the community (E. F.
Canard et al., 2014; Krishna et al., 2008). Here links are solely
determined by the relative abundance of the different species in the
community. Although it is highly unlikely that abundance is the only
determinant of interactions work by Pomeranz et al. (2019) showcases how
these neutral processes can be used in conjunction with inductive models
to construct more refined/localised networks.

There is a broader group of models that focus on determining
interactions in terms of energetic constraints on diet breadth, often
using the ratio of consumer-resource bodysize as a proxy for capturing
the energetic constraints of feeding. Models such as those developed by
Portalier et al. (2019) and Wootton et al. (2023) are similar to the
mechanistic approaches discussed in Section~\ref{sec-construct-induct},
however instead of determining interactions based on mechanistic
feasibility it is rather constrained by the energetic cost of predation.
Note that although these models do not place any explicit constraints on
the expected structure of the network, the links should still be
considered as `realised' owing to the energetic constraint placed on
links. A different subset of diet models (\emph{e.g.,} Beckerman et al.,
2006; Petchey et al., 2008) use a diet choice approach, however similar
to the stochastic network models they also embed assumptions on network
structure. Thus these models predict both interactions and network
structure simultaneously, although they would benefit in being refined
by more explicitly accounting for trait-based (\emph{i.e.,} feasibility)
parameterisation (Curtsdotter et al., 2019).

\section{Making Progress with Networks}\label{sec-progress}

The motivation to leverage network ecology in conservation ecology,
environmental risk assessment and natural resource management stems from
a shift away from species/population specific measures of the effects of
stress and disturbance to community level metrics of these impacts.
These metrics, such as resilience and more generally stability,
ecosystem function and biodiversity \emph{per se}, are natural
properties of networks. This suggests that modern conservation, risk
assessment and resource management requires robust network tools to
support decision making.

This is also true in the disciplines of ecology and environmental
science and their focus on abundance, distribution, functions and
services that biodiversity provides (Loreau \& de Mazancourt, 2013).
Major questions remain, for example, about
stability-diversity-productivity relationships, the impacts of
extinctions and invasions and the impacts of multiple stressors
operating at multiple ecological scales. A network approach to answering
these types of questions specifically allows us to evaluate how
environmental gradients and anthropogenic stress map through direct and
indirect effects among species in a complex community and reveal
fundamental patterns and understanding of processes in the natural
world.

In order to effectively use networks to aid us in answering questions
about conservation/risk assessment/management and core ecological
theory, we need to be mindful that we are mapping the \emph{correct}
network representation to the question of interest (Gauzens et al.,
2025). Notably, there are certain questions that cannot be answered
using specific network representations as the scale of the question of
interest is fundamentally misaligned with either the process captured by
a specific network representation Section~\ref{sec-process-feasibility},
the underlying data that is used to construct it
Section~\ref{sec-construct} or both of these factors.

Here we discuss and map the different network representations shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-process} to `appropriate' research questions and agendas
see also~\ref{tbl-questions}. We also highlight some of the key
methodological challenges that currently limit our conceptualisation of
a `network' and thus impact their effective practical application in
real world settings.

\subsection{Key Eco-Evo-Conservation
Questions}\label{key-eco-evo-conservation-questions}

\subsubsection{Global Metawebs}\label{sec-progress_metaweb}

The interactions in global metawebs are not constrained by the
realisation of specific community assemblages (or species
co-occurrence). These networks provide a platform for answering
questions that assume interactions \emph{could} occur between species
(feasibility) or where the potential diet breadth of species is
required. Examples of appropriate research questions at this scale
includes those about \emph{hypothetical} or \emph{novel} communities and
interactions under future climate change scenarios, or the potential
`position' of an invasive (or re-introduced) species within a network
(Hui \& Richardson, 2019). This scale is also appropriate for a
particular class of questions related to the potential
(eco-evolutionary) rewiring capacity of species, and how this may help
inform on the opportunities for persistence of species within new
community assemblages (Marjakangas et al., 2025). The implicit focus on
feasibility in these examples highlights that global metawebs are linked
to strong proxies for targets and mechanisms of evolutionary change.
This offers a network scale for modelling ecological-evolutionary
dynamics and the role that both the evolutionary history, natural
selection, and phenotypic plasticity shapes the diet breadth of species.

\subsubsection{Regional Metawebs}\label{sec-progress_regional}

Regional metawebs are conceptually a spatially constrained global
metaweb. They make explicit the co-occurence between species. Against
this backdrop, they are conceptually aligned with similar questions to
those posed above, with the added focus on a community facing,
real-world, challenge. Additionally, regional metawebs can and have been
used to refine and constrain species distribution model predictions,
giving us more refined range maps (García-Callejas et al., 2023) or
community composition under climate change scenarios, even at global
scales (Hao et al., 2025).

However we must exercise a high degree of caution when comparing
structures among regional metwebs, whether discrete collections or along
environmental gradients. At this scale, where the network embeds the
assumptions of feasibility, the link distribution is not meaningfully
constrained by environmental factors (see Section~\ref{sec-edge}) and it
is vital to disentangle structural change \emph{per se} from the
multiple processes that might determine species turnover (\emph{e.g.,}
\(\beta\) - diversity).

\subsubsection{Realised networks}\label{realised-networks}

Realised network are the most representative of what comes to mind when
people think of networks, and more specifically how we can use them to
help inform on larger biogeographic processes (Thuiller et al., 2024).
This is partially because of the popularity and legacy of generative
network models (like the Cascade and Niche model) which produce realised
network representations, and represent the ideal `currency' for which to
understand the constraints placed on interactions/network structure by
the broader community and environmental context. This change in currency
and context affords us the opportunity to ask questions that revolve
around major ecological theory - \emph{e.g.,} community stability and
resilience, biodiversity dynamics, ecosystem function,
structure-function relationships - and around major conservation and
climate change global challenges - \emph{e.g.,} temperature change,
extinction dynamics, invasion impacts and reintroductions/rewilding.

Realised networks embody an explicit focus on the link between network
structure to ecosystem function. Because the structure of realised webs
are isolated from turnover processes they allow us to think about the
propagation of change (across both time and space) which allows us to
ask questions about the persistence of communities and how they respond
to perturbations or stressors (at both the level of the node as well as
the modification of links). For example in
Section~\ref{sec-progress_metaweb} we discuss how global metawebs can
inform as to the rewiring \emph{capacity} of a species, a realised
network however would be better suited to capture the rewiring of
networks over time as a response to changes in the environment or
community.

Although the recent boom in the availability of long-term observation
data is allowing us to unpack decades of insights for
stability-diversity-productivity relationships for more complex
communities (Danet et al., 2024) or to evaluate the impacts and efficacy
of re-introductions (Wooster et al., 2024), we need to be mindful that
empirical interaction data is typically accumulated over time and so it
compresses the transient nature of the interactions between species
(Polis, 1991). Thus we need to apply a degree of caution when using
empirical data to construct realised networks - although there is scope
to think about developing methods that will allow us to modify metawebs
in such a way that their structures become more aligned with realised
webs (see the next section).

\subsection{Key methodological
challenges}\label{key-methodological-challenges}

As noted above, the three types of networks help highlight longstanding
methodological challenges that affect our ability to increase both
precision and accuracy of inference derived from the questions we
highlight above. Here we review some of these challenges and
opportunities that are arising to mitigate them.

\textbf{Understanding what empirical data represents:} Ultimately,
knowing what is right/precise/correct in an ecological network requires
robust data. What does it mean when we `observe' an interaction be that
directly (predator actively feeding on prey) or indirectly via
\emph{e.g.,} gut or isotope analysis. A network constructed with
empirical data will most likely still represent an `accumulation' of
feeding data making it conceptually more closely aligned with idea of a
metaweb.

\textbf{The validation of network structure:} Progress has been made in
the development of tools and approaches of assessing how well a model
recovers pairwise interactions (Poisot, 2023; Strydom et al., 2021), but
we still lack a clear set of guidelines for benchmarking the ability of
models to recover structure (Allesina et al., 2008). This makes it
challenging to assess if models are capturing network structure
accurately, especially if one wants to use empirical data as the
`testing set'. Specifically, can we use a network constructed using
long-term interaction observation data (\emph{i.e.,} conceptually a
metaweb) to assess the accuracy of a modelled (\emph{I don't know how I
feel about this word}), realised network? Additionally one needs to
think about \emph{what} aspect of accurate/precise network construction
is the most important - is it the structure or ability to correctly
predict pairwise links? In the case of attempting to construct a metaweb
it is important that one is accurately recovering both links that are
truly present and absent, however in the case of realised webs it is
perhaps not that clear. Is it sufficient to correctly recover structure
\emph{e.g.,} connectance or do the pairwise links also need to be
correct?

\textbf{Transitioning between metawebs and realised webs:} Currently
most approaches to modelling realised networks fail to explicitly
account for any form of evolutionary constraint (although see Van De
Walle et al. (2023) and Wootton et al. (2023)) and we need to develop
either an ensemble modelling approach (Becker et al., 2022; Terry \&
Lewis, 2020) or tools that will allow for the downsampling of metawebs
into realised networks, (\emph{e.g.,} Roopnarine, 2006).

Importantly we need to think critically how the creation of either an
`ensemble network' or downsampled metaweb might change the underlying
`currency' of a network and thus the underling definition of the edge
\emph{e.g.} the downsampling approach developed by Roopnarine (2006)
structurally constrains the network to structurally look like a realised
web, but the links to not represent prey choice \emph{per se}.

Having a well developed framework as well as `fluidity' to allow us to
scale up between meta- and realised food webs lays the groundwork for us
to actively begin the integration of food webs into the classical
metacommunity-metaecosystem space (Massol et al., 2011) as well as
ecosystem level processes (Liu et al., 2025). The being said
developments in the community-ecosystem space should be intentional
about articulating a firm distinction as to what defines a `network' as
a unit, as well as defining the logical (spatial and temporal)
boundaries between networks (Fortin et al., 2021).

\textbf{Making networks more tractable in applied spaces:} There is a
disconnect when it comes to effectively using networks in applied
spaces. This is probably at least in part related to the challenges with
delineating `boundaries' between networks, and specifically how these
relate to `management units' and scales in addition to a limited
interpretability of network metrics, specifically how this can be
applied to conservation targets/indices (Dansereau, Braga, et al.,
2024). In order to address these shortcomings we need to make an effort
to more efficiently map the form (structure) of a network to its
function in order to identify how this can effectively be integrated
into policy to make it meaningful and actionable (O'Connor et al.,
2025), all while remaining mindful to ensure that we identify the
appropriate network representation.

\section{Concluding remarks}\label{concluding-remarks}

Having a clear understanding of the interplay between network
representations and the processes that they are capable of encoding is
critical if we are to understand exactly which networks can be used to
answer which questions. As we highlight in Section~\ref{sec-progress}
the different network representations have different potential uses and
it should be clear that there is no `best' network representation but
rather a network representation that is best suited to its intended
purpose. In providing a formalisation regards to the assumptions and
mechanisms that need to be explicitly taken into consideration when
deciding to use (and construct) networks we hope to prevent the
unintentional misuse or misinterpretation of networks as well as provide
a starting point from which we can develop a better framework for the
applied use of networks to answer questions that are not only pressing
within the field but also within broader biodiversity science.
